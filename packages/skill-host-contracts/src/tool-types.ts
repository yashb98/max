/**
 * Tool-related type declarations shared between the daemon and any
 * skill-side package that needs to describe tools, permission risk, or tool
 * execution results on the wire.
 *
 * Pure type-level declarations only (+ the `RiskLevel` enum, which is a value
 * but is safely cross-package). No runtime helpers live here — the assistant
 * keeps all behavior functions in `assistant/src/tools/` and re-exports the
 * types from this file.
 *
 * Heavy daemon-internal references (CES client, host-proxy classes, trust
 * classifications, interface IDs, content blocks, CES `ApprovalRequired`)
 * are held as opaque `unknown` / broadened-`string` placeholders on this
 * side so the contracts package never reaches into the assistant or the
 * service-contracts runtime. The assistant redeclares `Tool`, `ToolContext`,
 * `ToolExecutionResult`, `ToolExecutedEvent`, `ToolLifecycleEvent`,
 * `ToolLifecycleEventHandler`, and `ProxyToolResolver` in
 * `assistant/src/tools/types.ts` with the concrete types in place, so
 * existing call sites keep their full type information. The two sides are
 * structurally independent — no inheritance, no intersection — which
 * avoids TypeScript's contravariance mismatches on lifecycle-event
 * handlers.
