/**
 * @vellumai/gateway-client
 *
 * Shared client package for assistant-to-gateway communication. Provides
 * HTTP delivery, trust-rule CRUD, and Unix-socket IPC helpers that the
 * assistant daemon uses to interact with the gateway service.
 *
 * This package is intentionally free of imports from `assistant/` or
 * `gateway/` so both sides can depend on it without circular references.
