/**
 * Connection-aware provider resolution helpers.
 *
 * These wrap `resolveProviderFromConnection` (in `registry.ts`) with the
 * DB lookup and lifecycle of a `provider_connection` reference. The
 * canonical dispatch path (`provider-send-message.ts`) and each satellite
 * site (subagent manager, daemon conversation/approval/guardian generators,
 * rollup producer) use these helpers so that connection-awareness behaves
 * identically across the codebase.
 *
 * Resolution policy:
 *   1. The profile MUST name a `provider_connection`. The boot-time
 *      backfill ensures every profile has one; a missing connection name
 *      is a configuration bug.
 *   2. Hard config errors (DB lookup throws, row not found, provider
 *      mismatch with the resolving profile) throw so misconfigurations
 *      surface immediately rather than silently rerouting.
 *   3. Soft credential issues (`resolveProviderFromConnection` returns
 *      null because the credential isn't set in the vault, or the
 *      auth bundle yields no usable adapter) return null. Callers are
 *      free to treat null as "no provider available" and fall back to
 *      a graceful no-op (e.g. rollup producer skips, satellite throw
 *      with their own actionable message).
 *   4. Transient failures inside the resolver (managed-proxy context
 *      lookup, credential read I/O) are caught and treated like a soft
 *      credential issue (return null). A transient blip should not take
 *      a conversation offline.
