/**
 * Tests for `isToolActiveForContext` host-tool capability gating.
 *
 * Scenarios verified:
 * - chrome-extension is its own executor and is exempt from the hasNoClient
 *   gate (the extension's own popup UI gates commands; there is no SSE
 *   interactive approval channel, and chrome-extension turns intentionally
 *   run with `hasNoClient: true` because chrome-extension is not in
 *   `INTERACTIVE_INTERFACES`).
 * - macos requires a connected SSE client for host tools that flow through
 *   the proxy (e.g. host_bash, host_file_*, host_browser), so
 *   `hasNoClient: true` denies those on macos.
 * - host_browser IS in the macos capability set — the proxy routes
 *   host_browser_request frames to the desktop client via SSE (or via the
 *   Chrome extension registry when an extension connection is present).
 *
 * The per-capability check (`supportsHostProxy(transport, capability)`) runs
 * first and is authoritative for structural support, so host_bash and
 * host_file_* are filtered out for chrome-extension regardless of the
 * hasNoClient flag.
 *
 * Cross-client exception: tools whose capabilities are in
 * CROSS_CLIENT_EXPOSED_CAPABILITIES (host_bash, host_file, host_browser)
 * are allowed for non-host-proxy interactive interfaces ("web", "ios")
 * when at least one capable client is connected via the event hub.
 * chrome-extension is excluded as a security boundary, regardless of
 * whether the capability is technically supported elsewhere.
