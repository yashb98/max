/**
 * Plugin bootstrap — runs every registered plugin's `init()` hook once during
 * daemon startup.
 *
 * Plugins register themselves via side-effect imports elsewhere in the boot
 * sequence (first-party) or at runtime (hot-reload). By the time
 * {@link bootstrapPlugins} runs, the registry has been fully populated for
 * this boot cycle. This function:
 *
 * 1. Registers the canonical first-party default plugins via
 *    {@link registerDefaultPlugins} (one per pipeline). Registration is
 *    idempotent so repeat calls (e.g. during integration tests) do not throw.
 * 2. Walks {@link getRegisteredPlugins} in registration order.
 * 3. For each plugin, consults `manifest.requiresFlag` against
 *    {@link isAssistantFeatureFlagEnabled}. If any listed flag is disabled,
 *    the plugin is skipped wholesale — no `init()`, no tool/route/skill
 *    contributions, no entry in the shutdown hook, and the plugin is also
 *    dropped from the registry via {@link unregisterPlugin} so its middleware
 *    and injectors stop participating in pipeline runs and system-prompt
 *    assembly. This is the primary mechanism for shipping experimental
 *    plugins behind a feature flag.
 * 4. Resolves the plugin's `manifest.requiresCredential` entries via the
 *    credential store helper ({@link getSecureKeyAsync}). In Docker mode
 *    that helper goes through the CES HTTP API transparently; in local mode
 *    it hits the encrypted file store / CES RPC backend.
 * 5. Validates the config block under `plugins.<name>` against
 *    `manifest.config` if the manifest supplies a parser-like validator
 *    (Zod schemas with `.parse()` are supported; anything else is passed
 *    through untouched).
 * 6. Creates `<workspaceDir>/plugins-data/<plugin>/` on demand for per-plugin
 *    writable state and exposes it via {@link PluginInitContext.pluginStorageDir}.
 * 7. Awaits `plugin.init(ctx)` sequentially. One init failure surfaces as a
 *    {@link PluginExecutionError} naming the offending plugin and aborts
 *    bootstrap — later plugins' `init()` never runs and the daemon fails
 *    startup cleanly rather than coming up in a half-wired state.
 * 8. After a plugin's `init()` succeeds, registers any tools declared on
 *    `plugin.tools` with the global tool registry via
 *    {@link registerPluginTools}. Tool contributions land after `init()` so
 *    a plugin that fails mid-init never leaves partial tool registrations
 *    behind.
 *
 * A single shutdown hook is registered via
 * {@link registerShutdownHook} that walks the plugin list in **reverse
 * registration order**. Only plugins that actually initialized (i.e. were
 * not skipped by the feature-flag gate) appear in that walk. For each such
 * plugin it first unregisters the contributed tools (so `onShutdown()`
 * observes a clean model-visible surface) and then awaits the optional
 * `onShutdown()`. Per-plugin shutdown failures are logged and swallowed —
 * the hook registry already swallows hook-level throws, but we log at the
 * plugin level so the plugin name is attributed.
