/**
 * `MeetHostSupervisor` — owns the lifecycle of the lazily-spawned
 * `bun run skills/meet-join/register.ts` child process (the meet-host).
 *
 * The daemon stays skill-agnostic at the process layer: the supervisor
 * is the one place that knows how to find the bun binary, resolve the
 * installed skill path, spawn the child, wait for its handshake, count
 * active sessions, and idle-shut it down. The IPC surface between the
 * two processes lives in `assistant/src/ipc/skill-server.ts` and the
 * `host.registries.*` routes that back it.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle
 *
 *   - `ensureRunning()` — idempotent. First caller triggers
 *     `child_process.spawn`, subsequent concurrent callers await the
 *     same in-flight promise. Resolves once the child dials
 *     `assistant-skill.sock` and the first `host.registries.register_*`
 *     frame lands (which calls {@link setActiveConnection}). Source-hash
 *     drift is not validated on this path — `notifyHandshake` exists for
 *     a future explicit handshake frame that ships the skill's
 *     runtime-computed hash, but no production caller invokes it today.
 *
 *   - `reportSessionStarted(id)` / `reportSessionEnded(id)` — mutate
 *     the active-session counter, called by the
 *     `host.registries.report_session_*` IPC routes. The counter is
 *     tracked by session id (Set of live ids) so duplicate or
 *     out-of-order `ended` frames can't drop the count below zero.
 *
 *   - `setActiveConnection(connection)` / `clearActiveConnection()` —
 *     called by the `host.registries.register_*` route handlers when
 *     the child sends its first registration frame. Pinning the live
 *     `SkillIpcConnection` lets `dispatchTool/Route/Shutdown` route
 *     daemon→skill RPC traffic to the right peer.
 *
 *   - `dispatchTool` / `dispatchRoute` / `dispatchShutdown` — send
 *     `skill.dispatch_*` / `skill.shutdown` frames to the meet-host
 *     child over the active connection and resolve with its response.
 *     Used by the manifest proxies installed in `meet-manifest-loader`.
 *
 *   - Idle timer — when the counter reaches zero the supervisor arms
 *     a 5-minute timer (configurable via
 *     `services.meet.host.idle_timeout_ms`). On expiry it sends a
 *     `skill.shutdown` frame over the IPC socket (best-effort — if no
 *     IPC sink is wired yet the supervisor still falls through to the
 *     signal path), waits briefly for graceful exit, then
 *     SIGTERM/SIGKILLs the child. Any new session before the timer
 *     fires disarms it.
 *
 *   - Crash detection — the supervisor listens for the child's `exit`
 *     event; when it fires unexpectedly the handle is nulled and the
 *     next `ensureRunning()` call respawns.
 *
 *   - `shutdown()` — graceful termination on daemon shutdown.
