/**
 * Shared host-proxy skill preactivation registry.
 *
 * Several call sites need to mark host-proxy-backed skills as preactivated
 * for a turn whenever the source interface supports the corresponding
 * `HostProxyCapability`:
 *
 *   - `runtime/routes/conversation-routes.ts` (create path, /v1/messages)
 *   - `daemon/process-message.ts` (create path, prepareConversationForMessage)
 *   - `daemon/conversation-process.ts` `drainSingleMessage` (re-add after dequeue)
 *   - `daemon/conversation-process.ts` `drainBatch` (re-add after dequeue)
 *
 * The create paths additionally instantiate the proxy itself; that
 * instantiation logic is per-proxy-class and stays inline at each create
 * site (constructors take different argument shapes — `HostCuProxy()` vs
 * `HostAppControlProxy(conversationId)`). This module owns only the
 * capability-to-skill mapping and the preactivation step. Adding a new
 * host-proxy-backed skill is a one-line registry change here instead of
 * touching all four call sites.
 *
 * Why a registry instead of repeated branches: each new host-proxy-backed
 * skill that ships (e.g. a future `host_focus` capability with a `focus`
 * skill) would otherwise add four near-identical `if (supportsHostProxy(...))
 * conversation.addPreactivatedSkillId("...")` blocks across these files.
 * Centralizing the list makes the contract obvious and prevents drift
 * where one call site re-adds a skill but another forgets to.
