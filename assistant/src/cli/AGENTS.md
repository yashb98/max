# Assistant CLI — Agent Instructions

## Purpose

Commands in `assistant/src/cli/` are scoped to a **single running assistant instance**. They operate on the assistant's local state — config, memory, contacts, trust rules, conversations, autonomy, etc. — and run within the context of the assistant's workspace.

This contrasts with `cli/`, which manages the **lifecycle of assistant instances** (create, start, stop, delete) and operates across instances. See `cli/AGENTS.md`.

## Scope

Commands here operate on a **single running assistant's** local state — config, memory, contacts, trust rules, conversations, autonomy, etc. They are implicitly scoped to the running assistant and may require or start the daemon.

For commands that manage the **lifecycle of assistant instances** (create, start, stop, delete), see `cli/AGENTS.md`.

Examples: `config`, `contacts`, `memory`, `autonomy`, `conversations` belong here. `hatch`, `wake`, `sleep`, `retire`, `ps`, `ssh` belong in `cli/`.

## Conventions

- Commands use [Commander.js](https://github.com/tj/commander.js) and follow the `registerXCommand(program: Command)` pattern.
- Each command module exports a registration function that attaches subcommands to the program.
- Register new commands in `assistant/src/cli/program.ts` inside the `buildCliProgram()` function by importing and calling the registration function.
- Use `getCliLogger("cli")` for output (not raw `console.log`).
- When adding/removing/renaming assistant CLI commands or subcommands, update the gateway bash risk registry coverage in `gateway/src/risk/command-registry/commands/assistant.ts` (supported command paths + risk overrides) so permission prompts stay correct.

## Service calls — transport-based dispatch

CLI commands use one of two transport patterns depending on whether they need a running daemon:

- **`ipc`-tagged commands** call `cliIpcCall` from `../../ipc/cli-client.js`. They are thin wrappers that forward requests to the daemon over the IPC socket and never import daemon-internal modules.
- **`local`-tagged commands** read or write workspace files directly (config, autonomy, completions, etc.) using the same config/store helpers the daemon uses internally. They do not require the daemon to be running.

Both transport classes avoid proxying through the gateway HTTP API. `ipc` commands reach the daemon directly via the socket; `local` commands bypass the daemon entirely. The transport tag is declared via `registerCommand({ transport, ... })` — see the "Transport tagging" section below.

## Transport tagging

Every command file declares its transport class via `registerCommand({ transport, ... })`
from `../lib/register-command.ts`. The three transport classes are:

| Class | Rule | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `ipc` | Wraps exactly one IPC method per subcommand. No daemon-internal imports. | Commands that call the daemon |
| `local` | Touches only static workspace files / shell artifacts. | Commands that work without a running daemon |
| `bootstrap` | Runs before the daemon is up (e.g. `assistant config init`). | Pre-daemon setup |

The ESLint rule `cli/no-daemon-internals` enforces import allowlists per class.

## Anatomy of an `ipc` command

The thin-wrapper pattern. Every `ipc`-tagged subcommand action does three
things: parse argv → call one IPC method → format output. The business
logic lives in the daemon route, not the CLI.

### Required shape

```ts
// assistant/src/cli/commands/foo.ts
import type { Command } from "commander";

import { cliIpcCall, exitFromIpcResult } from "../../ipc/cli-client.js";
import { registerCommand } from "../lib/register-command.js";
import { writeOutput } from "../output.js";

interface FooBarResponse {
  bars: { id: string; name: string }[];
}

export function registerFooCommand(program: Command): void {
  registerCommand(program, {
    name: "foo",
    transport: "ipc",
    description: "Manage foos",
    build: (foo) => {
      foo
        .command("bar")
        .description("List bars")
        .option("--baz <n>", "Filter by baz")
        .action(async (opts, cmd) => {
          const r = await cliIpcCall<FooBarResponse>("foo_bar", {
            baz: opts.baz,
          });
          if (!r.ok) return exitFromIpcResult(r);
          writeOutput(cmd, r.result);
        });
    },
  });
}
```

Then wire it from `program.ts` inside `buildCliProgram()`:

```ts
import { registerFooCommand } from "./commands/foo.js";
// ...
registerFooCommand(program);
```

### Rules

1. **One `registerCommand` call per file.** The options object MUST be
   passed inline as an object literal; `name` and `transport` MUST be
   string literals. Hoisted variables and `as const` casts break the
   static analysis tools rely on.

2. **No daemon-internal imports.** An `ipc` command file can import:

   - the IPC client (`../../ipc/cli-client`)
   - the Commander framework + Node stdlib (`commander`, `node:*`)
   - shared CLI helpers (`../logger`, `../output`, `../lib/*`,
     `../../utils/*`)
   - sibling subcommand modules (`./connect`, etc. — for namespace
     parents like `oauth/index.ts`)

   It **cannot** import anything under `runtime/`, `services/`,
   `agents/`, `llm/`, `skills/`, or any other daemon-internal namespace.
   The `cli/no-daemon-internals` ESLint rule enforces this at `"error"`
   severity. See `assistant/eslint-rules/cli-no-daemon-internals.js` for
   the per-transport allowlist (including per-command escape hatches for
   things like the `keys` security helpers and `credential-execution`
   bridge).

3. **One IPC call per subcommand action.** A thin wrapper does not
   compose multiple IPC methods, does not validate beyond Commander's
   argument parsing, and does not reshape the daemon response.
   Composition belongs on the daemon side, in a route.

4. **Always check `r.ok` before reading `r.result`.** `cliIpcCall`
   returns `CliIpcCallResult<T>` — either `{ ok: true, result }` or
   `{ ok: false, error, statusCode?, errorCode?, errorDetails? }`. Use
   `exitFromIpcResult(r)` to surface failure: it writes the error to
   stderr and exits with a code derived from the daemon-side
   `statusCode` (10 connect failure, 3 5xx, 2 4xx, 1 other).

5. **Output via `writeOutput(cmd, payload)`.** The shared helper writes
   JSON to stdout — compact with `--json`, pretty otherwise — and
   respects `--json` inherited from parent commands. Don't
   `console.log` results directly; that bypasses the convention and
   breaks downstream scripting.

### Anti-patterns

- ❌ `import { something } from "../../runtime/foo.js"` from an
  `ipc`-tagged command. The ESLint rule rejects this at `"error"`.
- ❌ `registerCommand(program, opts)` where `opts` is a hoisted
  variable. Inline the literal so the transport tag is statically
  visible.
- ❌ Multiple `registerCommand` calls in one file.
- ❌ Reshaping `r.result` to differ from what the route returns. If the
  CLI shape needs to diverge from the daemon response, change the
  route — the CLI is just a transport.
- ❌ Bypassing `exitFromIpcResult` to format your own error output.
  The shared helper gives consistent exit codes across the surface so
  scripts can branch on them.
- ❌ Calling the gateway HTTP API (`fetch`, `axios`) from a CLI
  command. All daemon work goes through IPC; the gateway is for
  external clients.

## IPC operation IDs and routes

Every `ipc`-tagged subcommand action maps to exactly one operation
served by the daemon's IPC server. Two route surfaces exist:

- **Shared routes (`assistant/src/runtime/routes/`).** Served over both
  HTTP and IPC via the shared `ROUTES` array. Most domain routes live
  here — dual exposure is by design so the gateway can call the daemon
  over IPC instead of HTTP. See `assistant/AGENTS.md` for the routes /
  dispatch architecture.
- **IPC-only routes (`assistant/src/ipc/routes/`).** CLI/tool-specific
  methods with no HTTP counterpart (e.g. `wake_conversation`,
  `upsert_contact`). Use this surface only when the operation
  shouldn't be exposed over HTTP — when in doubt, default to the
  shared surface.

Operation IDs are snake_case. The conventional shape is
`<command>_<subcommand>` (`pending_list`, `oauth_connect`,
`cache_get`), but verb-first names are also used where they read more
naturally (`upsert_contact`, `wake_conversation`, `conversations_import`).
Pick the form that makes the operation obvious from the ID alone.

The route owns the request schema (zod), the business logic, and the
response shape. The CLI just forwards arguments and renders the
response. When you add a new CLI verb you're almost always also adding
(or extending) a route — see the PR template's CLI verb checklist.

## Canonical example

`commands/pending.ts` is the reference implementation. Read it first
when migrating a legacy command or unsure about a pattern.
- Clean error handling via `exitFromIpcResult`
- No daemon-internal imports

When migrating a legacy command, start by reading `pending.ts`.

## Help Text Standards

Every command at every level (namespace, subcommand, nested subcommand) must have
high-quality `--help` output optimized for AI/LLM consumption. Help text is a
primary interface — both humans and AI agents read it to understand what a command
does and how to use it.

### Requirements

1. **Top-level namespace**: Use `.description()` with a concise one-liner, then
   `.addHelpText("after", ...)` with:
   - A brief explanation of the domain and key concepts (e.g. naming conventions,
     storage model)
   - 3-4 representative examples covering the most common workflows

2. **Each subcommand**: Use `.description()` with a one-liner, then
   `.addHelpText("after", ...)` with:
   - An `Arguments:` block explaining each positional argument with its format
     and constraints
   - Behavioral notes (what happens on update vs create, what gets deleted, etc.)
   - 2-3 concrete `Examples:` showing exact invocations with realistic values

3. **Write for machines**: Help text is frequently parsed by AI agents to decide
   which command to run and how. Be precise about formats (`service:field`),
   constraints (required vs optional), and side effects. Avoid vague language
   like "configure settings" — say exactly what is configured and where it's stored.

4. **Use Commander's `.addHelpText("after", ...)`** for extended help. Don't
   cram everything into `.description()`.

### No Redundant Command Lists in `addHelpText`

Commander already renders a `Commands:` section from registered subcommands.
Never duplicate that list in `.addHelpText("after", ...)`. The `addHelpText`
block is for **supplementary context only** — domain notes, key concepts, and
examples. Repeating command names and descriptions wastes vertical space and
creates a maintenance burden (two places to update when a subcommand changes).

**Bad:**

```ts
oauth.addHelpText(
  "after",
  `
The oauth command group manages the full OAuth lifecycle:

  connect     Initiate an OAuth flow for a provider
  disconnect  Disconnect an OAuth provider
  ...
`,
);
```

**Good:**

```ts
oauth.addHelpText(
  "after",
  `
Providers are seeded on startup for built-in integrations. Apps and connections
are created during the OAuth authorization flow or can be managed manually via
their respective subcommands.

Examples:
  $ assistant oauth connect google
  $ assistant oauth status google
`,
);
```

### ID and Key Arguments

Options that accept IDs, keys, or opaque identifiers must include a short note
explaining how to discover the value via another CLI command. Without this,
users and AI agents have no way to know what to pass.

**Bad:**

```ts
.option("--app-id <id>", "App ID (UUID)")
```

**Good:**

```ts
.option("--app-id <id>", "App ID (UUID) — run 'assistant oauth apps list' to find it")
```

Common discovery patterns:

| Argument type | Discovery command                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Provider key  | `assistant oauth providers list`    |
| Connection ID | `assistant oauth status <provider>` |
| OAuth app ID  | `assistant oauth apps list`         |
| Contact ID    | `assistant contacts list`           |

### Error Messages

Every error message must be **actionable** — when a command fails, the user or
AI agent must know what to do next. Each error needs two components:

1. **What went wrong** — a clear description of the failure.
2. **What to do** — a specific CLI command or next step to resolve it.

**Bad:**

```ts
throw new Error("Connection not found");
```

**Good:**

```ts
throw new Error(
  `Connection "${id}" not found. Run 'assistant oauth status <provider>' to see available connections.`,
);
```

Common error patterns:

| Failure                  | Suggested action                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Resource not found       | Suggest the `list` or `status` command for that resource type |
| Missing prerequisite     | Suggest the `create`, `register`, or `connect` command        |
| Ambiguous input          | List the available options and suggest a disambiguation flag  |
| Mutually exclusive flags | Name both conflicting flags and explain which to drop         |

### Deprecation Hygiene

When a command is removed, clean up completely:

1. **Remove all implementation code** — the command registration, handler, and
   any helper functions that only served the removed command.
2. **Remove test mocks and fixtures** — delete test files, mock data, and helper
   functions that only existed for the removed command.
3. **Update references** — search for string references to the old command in
   docs, skills, fixtures, help text, and comments. Update or remove them.
4. **No deprecation shims** — do not add shims that forward the old command to
   the new one unless there is a documented migration window with a specific
   removal date. Silent forwarding hides technical debt and confuses agents
   that discover both old and new commands in help output.
