/**
 * Cross-process snapshot mutex.
 *
 * The backup worker's in-process `snapshotInProgress` flag only protects one
 * process from racing itself. A CLI `vellum backup create` run against a live
 * daemon has its own independent copy of the flag, so both processes could
 * drive the pipeline concurrently: two WAL checkpoints against the live DB,
 * two renames into the same `backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.vbundle` path (the second
 * silently clobbering the first), and two retention-pruner passes racing.
 *
 * This module provides a small cross-process lock backed by an atomic
 * `O_CREAT | O_EXCL` file create under `~/.vellum/backups/.snapshot.lock`.
 * The in-process flag is kept as a fast path; this lock is the source of
 * truth whenever two processes could collide.
 *
 * The implementation mirrors the pattern in `daemon/daemon-control.ts`'s
 * startup lock, with two refinements:
 *   1. The lock file contains the holder's PID so we can detect stale locks
 *      by probing liveness with `kill(pid, 0)` rather than a fixed timeout.
 *   2. Acquisition returns a release function so callers can wire it into
 *      a `try/finally` without plumbing a separate release import.

 *
 * On conflict with a live holder, throws an error whose message STARTS WITH
 * "snapshot in progress" so existing consumers that match on that prefix
 * (HTTP 409 mapping, CLI error output) continue to work without change.
 *
 * ## Stale-lock takeover (TOCTOU-safe)
 *
 * The naive "detect stale → unlink → re-acquire" pattern has a TOCTOU
 * race: two processes can both observe the same stale lock, both call
 * `unlink`, and the second unlink removes the *fresh* lock the first
 * process just re-acquired. Both then succeed at `O_EXCL` create and
 * believe they own the lock.
 *
 * This implementation uses a **rename-aside-then-verify** pattern instead:
 *
 *   1. Atomically rename the stale lock to a unique sideband path
 *      (`<lockPath>.stale.<pid>.<timestamp>`). `rename(2)` is atomic; if two
 *      processes race, only one wins. The loser sees `ENOENT` and retries
 *      the acquire loop from the top.
 *   2. The winner attempts `O_EXCL` create on the now-empty `lockPath`. On
 *      success it unlinks the sideband file and verifies ownership by
 *      reading back the PID it wrote.
 *   3. Post-acquire verification runs for *every* successful create (not
 *      just the takeover path). If the read-back PID doesn't match
 *      `process.pid`, we release our idea-of-a-lock as a race and throw —
 *      crucially, without unlinking, so we don't destroy whoever does own
 *      it.
 *
 * ## Partial-write handling
 *
 * There is a tiny window between `openSync(O_EXCL)` succeeding and
 * `writeSync(payload)` completing where another reader could observe a
 * zero-byte lock file. An empty file is ambiguous: it might be a dead
 * writer's debris, OR it might belong to a *live* holder that has just
 * won `O_EXCL` and not yet flushed the PID. We re-read up to
 * `EMPTY_FILE_MAX_RETRIES` times with a short delay; only a lock file
 * with a parseable PID whose owner is not running is ever taken over.
 * If the file is still unreadable after the retry budget, we surface a
 * conflict — unlinking it would race the live-holder case and risk
 * letting two snapshots run concurrently (the exact corruption scenario
 * this lock exists to prevent).
 *
 * ## Bounded retry
 *
 * The loop is bounded by `MAX_ACQUIRE_ITERATIONS`. A pathological contention
 * pattern (e.g. many backup processes each taking over each other's leftovers
 * faster than we can verify ownership) cannot turn into an unbounded spin.
 * After the bound is exhausted we surface a conflict so callers retry.
 *
 * The lock directory is created on demand so first-run scenarios (no
 * `~/.vellum/backups` yet) work without a separate bootstrap step.
