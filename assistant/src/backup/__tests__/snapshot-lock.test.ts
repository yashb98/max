/**
 * Tests for the cross-process snapshot lock helper. Each test gets a fresh
 * temp directory so runs never collide with the real `~/.vellum/backups`
 * directory and so parallel test workers never see each other's lock files.
 *
 * The interesting corners covered here are:
 *   - Acquire → release round-trip leaves the filesystem clean
 *   - A second acquire against a held lock throws with the expected prefix
 *   - A dead-PID lock file (simulated by writing a garbage PID that is not
 *     alive on this host) is taken over transparently
 *   - The release function is idempotent — calling it twice is a no-op
 *   - The lock file is created with mode `0o600` so an unprivileged
 *     peer on the same machine cannot read the holder PID
 *   - **TOCTOU mutual exclusion**: two concurrent acquires against a stale
 *     lock end up with exactly one winner (no double-acquire, no lost lock)
 *   - **Rename-aside**: takeover does not unlink-then-reacquire, so an
 *     interleaved second acquirer cannot destroy the fresh lock
