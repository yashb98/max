// Pure re-exports below cover types the contracts package could declare
// without any assistant-side references. The remaining interfaces (`Tool`,
// `ToolContext`, `ToolExecutionResult`, `ToolExecutedEvent`,
// `ToolLifecycleEvent`, `ToolLifecycleEventHandler`, `ProxyToolResolver`)
// reference daemon-internal types (CES client, host-proxy classes,
// `ContentBlock`, `ApprovalRequired`, `TrustClass`, `InterfaceId`,
// `SecretPromptResult`) that can't move into a neutral package. For those,
// the contracts version uses opaque placeholders (`unknown`, broadened
// `string`) and the assistant redeclares the interface here with the
// concrete types. The two sides are structurally independent — no
// inheritance, no intersection — which avoids TypeScript's contravariance
// mismatches on lifecycle-event handlers.
