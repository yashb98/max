/**
 * Route handler for channel availability.
 *
 * GET /v1/channels/available — return the channels this assistant can
 * surface to clients (Contacts / GuardianChannels views, etc.) along with
 * their display metadata (label, subtitle, icon, verification capability,
 * setup-message copy). Today this is a fixed base list plus `email` when
 * an inbox is registered; eventually the list will be driven by
 * plugins/skills the assistant has loaded. Clients should treat the
 * response as authoritative and stop carrying their own per-channel
 * switches.
 *
 * Distinct from `/v1/channels/readiness` (which answers "is this channel
 * configured and working?"). Availability answers "could this channel be
 * surfaced for setup/verification at all?".
