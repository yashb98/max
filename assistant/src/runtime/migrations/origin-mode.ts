/**
 * Origin-mode derivation for vbundle exports.
 *
 * The vbundle manifest v1 schema's `origin.mode` enum captures the deployment
 * shape that produced the bundle. The runtime's two underlying signals are:
 *
 *   - `hasManagedProxyPrereqs()` — true when the daemon has the credentials
 *     it needs to act as a managed-proxy client, i.e. this is a managed
 *     deployment.
 *   - `getDaemonRuntimeMode()` — `"docker"` vs `"bare-metal"`, identifying
 *     where the daemon process is running.
 *
 * Folding both into a single helper keeps callers from repeating the
 * combination logic.
