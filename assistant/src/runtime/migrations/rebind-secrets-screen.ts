/**
 * Rebind secrets screen -- view model for the rebind-secrets step.
 *
 * Derives display state from the migration wizard state machine for rendering
 * a post-migration task checklist UI. Usable from macOS/iOS web views, CLI,
 * or any TypeScript consumer.
 *
 * After a successful transfer, secrets (API keys, tokens) are redacted in
 * exported bundles and communication channels (Slack, Telegram, etc.) need
 * to be re-bound to the new instance. This screen presents a checklist of
 * tasks the operator must complete before the migration is considered done.
 *
 * View model states:
 *   - disabled: step is not yet accessible (earlier steps incomplete)
 *   - active: checklist is displayed with tasks to complete
 *   - complete: all required tasks are done, migration can be finalized
 *
 * Task categories:
 *   - re-enter-secrets: Re-enter API keys/secrets (redacted in bundles)
 *   - rebind-channels: Re-bind communication channels (Slack, Telegram, etc.)
 *   - reconfigure-auth: Re-configure identity/auth settings
 *   - verify-webhooks: Verify webhook URLs point to new instance
 *
 * Operator notes:
 *   Setup: Ensure the destination instance is running and reachable before
 *     starting the checklist. Secrets must be re-entered manually since
 *     they are never included in export bundles.
 *   Rollback: If a task cannot be completed, navigate back to transfer
 *     to re-import the bundle or start a new migration.
 *   Expected signals: Each task toggles between pending/complete. The
 *     "Complete Migration" action is only available when all required
 *     tasks are marked complete.
