/**
 * Gate for LLM-touching background work that runs between daemon start and
 * the user's first interaction.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Cloud-hosted assistants are served from a warm pool: the daemon boots,
 * background services initialize, and the image waits to be claimed by a
 * real user. Before the user claims an image, no provider credentials are
 * registered, so any background job that tries to call the LLM fails — and
 * those failure rows persist in the local SQLite database, becoming visible
 * in the conversation sidebar the moment the user hatches.
 *
 * ## The probe
 *
 * `hasReceivedUserMessage()` returns `true` once at least one
 * `role='user'` message exists in a `conversation_type='standard'`
 * conversation. Background / scheduled conversations don't count — they're
 * exactly the noise we're trying to suppress.
 *
 * The result is cached in-process after the first `true` because the flag
 * is monotonic: a user message, once present, is never deleted in a way
 * that should re-open the gate. (Even a destructive sweep that wipes all
 * messages would still want background jobs paused until a real user
 * interaction resumes, so re-querying on miss is the correct behavior.)
 *
 * Callers should treat the gate as advisory + defense-in-depth: prefer to
 * skip at the service level (heartbeat, update-bulletin, etc.) so no run
 * row / conversation row is created at all, and rely on the gate inside
 * `runBackgroundJob` as the universal backstop.

 *
 * Cheap: indexed lookup with `LIMIT 1`. After the first `true` result the
 * answer is cached in-process and subsequent calls are O(1).
 *
 * On query error the function logs a warning and returns `false` — the
 * conservative interpretation is "we can't prove the user has interacted,
 * so don't fire background work."
