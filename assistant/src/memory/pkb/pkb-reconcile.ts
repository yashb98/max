/**
 * PKB (Personal Knowledge Base) startup reconciliation.
 *
 * Diffs the on-disk PKB tree against the points currently indexed in Qdrant
 * and brings the two into alignment by enqueueing re-index jobs for
 * changed/new files and deleting Qdrant points for files that no longer
 * exist on disk.
 *
 * Safe to run on every daemon boot — idempotent. Intended to be invoked
 * fire-and-forget from daemon startup so the filesystem view stays
 * authoritative without blocking the first turn on scan latency.
