/**
 * Memory v2 — `memory_v2_consolidate` job handler.
 *
 * The consolidation job is the centerpiece of v2: an hourly background pass
 * that routes accumulated `memory/buffer.md` entries into concept pages,
 * rewrites `memory/recent.md`, promotes new essentials/threads, and trims the
 * buffer down to entries that arrived after the run started.
 *
 * Consolidation runs as the assistant: `runBackgroundJob()` bootstraps a
 * background conversation and routes the cutoff-templated prompt through
 * `processMessage`, so the standard system prompt (SOUL.md + IDENTITY.md +
 * persona + memory/* autoloads) and tool surface (read_file, write_file,
 * edit_file, list_files, bash) are loaded. Care, judgment, and the
 * assistant's voice are the point — there is no "consolidator persona" to
 * substitute in.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   1. Bail if `config.memory.v2.enabled` is false (the worker may have
 *      claimed a stale row from before v2 was disabled).
 *   2. Acquire a single-process lock at `memory/.v2-state/consolidation.lock`
 *      so two overlapping schedule windows can't fight over the same files.
 *      The lock contains the holder's PID + timestamp so a crashed run leaves
 *      a diagnosable trace.
 *   3. Capture the cutoff timestamp at dispatch. Any buffer entry timestamped
 *      at or after the cutoff arrived AFTER the run started — leave it for
 *      the next pass.
 *   4. Read `memory/buffer.md`. Bail if empty (no work to do, but the lock
 *      and skip path still log so operators can confirm the schedule fired).
 *   5. Hand off to `runBackgroundJob()` with the templated prompt. The runner
 *      handles bootstrap + processMessage + timeout + error classification,
 *      and (because we set `suppressFailureNotifications: true`) does NOT
 *      emit an `activity.failed` notification on transient failures —
 *      consolidation runs on tight intervals, so a network blip or model
 *      hiccup should not spam the home feed. Sentry-side reporting is
 *      unchanged. The prompt body is loaded via `resolveConsolidationPrompt`
 *      which bounds any operator-provided override to a regular file under
 *      1 MiB before substitution.
 *   6. On success, enqueue `memory_v2_reembed` (re-index any pages the agent
 *      touched). Tracking touched pages via mtime would be more precise but
 *      is fragile across filesystems; the embedder's content-hash cache makes
 *      a conservative full-reembed effectively free. On failure no follow-ups
 *      are enqueued — the agent's writes may be partial and re-embedding
 *      partial state would be misleading.
 *   7. Release the lock. If a prior holder's PID is no longer running, the
 *      stale lock is taken over automatically (single-writer per workspace,
 *      so a holder whose process died is unambiguously stale).
 *
 * The handler never propagates exceptions from the run path — `runBackgroundJob`
 * absorbs them and returns a structured result. A thrown error before the
 * runner is invoked (e.g. mkdir failures) bubbles up and the jobs-worker
 * treats it as a retryable failure.
