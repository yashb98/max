/**
 * Memory v2 — sweep prompt template.
 *
 * Body taken from §9 of the design doc (`memoized-spinning-wadler.md`). The
 * template uses two placeholders that the sweep job substitutes at runtime:
 *
 *   - `{{ASSISTANT_NAME}}` — the assistant's display name (from IDENTITY.md
 *     when available, else "the assistant" so the prompt still parses).
 *   - `{{USER_NAME}}` — the guardian's display name (from the guardian
 *     persona when available, else "the user").
 *
 * Kept here (under `prompts/`) rather than inlined in `sweep-job.ts` so the
 * prompt body is reviewable on its own and the job module stays focused on
 * orchestration. The same convention applies to the consolidation prompt
 * landing in PR 20.

 * Sweep prompt — body from design doc §9. The model is asked to surface
 * additional facts/preferences/plans/etc. that should be remembered but

 * call with an `entries` array; the runtime parses the response via the
 * tool definition declared in `sweep-job.ts`.
 *
 * The `existingBuffer` text is appended at the call site (rather than
 * templated here) so we don't inadvertently expand `{{` inside user buffer
 * content. Recent messages are likewise appended outside the template.
