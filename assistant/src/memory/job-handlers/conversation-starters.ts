${
  identityContext
    ? `## Assistant identity & user profile\n\n${identityContext}\n\n`
    : ""
}## What you know

${rollup}
${diff}
${skills}

## Selection

Generate exactly 8 starters, ranked #1 (best) to #8. The top 4 will be shown; the rest are fallbacks in case any fail downstream validation (e.g. label too long). Put real effort into every slot — any of them may end up displayed.

Start from the user's situation, not from the skill list. Ask yourself:
- What is this person likely dealing with right now (given the day/time and their context)?
- What's active, stuck, or coming up soon?
- Where could I save them real time or effort right now?

The skills list tells you what the assistant CAN do — use it to filter out suggestions the assistant can't actually help with, not as a menu to generate suggestions from.

For each starter, you must clearly answer:
- Why now? (timing — day of week, recent activity, upcoming deadline)
- Why this user? (grounded in their specific context, not generic)
- Why would they be glad I suggested this? (genuine usefulness, not just relevance)

If you can't answer all three strongly, replace it with something better.

Prioritize:
- Relief: unblock something stuck, reduce drag
- Momentum: advance work already in motion
- Confidence: surface what they need to decide or act on
- Curiosity: something timely they'd want to know about

Favor what is live over what is merely true. Recent changes matter more than old memories. Active work matters more than dormant topics. This week matters more than "someday."

## Output format

Each starter has:
- label: 3-6 words, max 40 chars, starts with a verb. Written in the user's voice — first-person about themselves, never referring to the user by name or in the third person. Something they'd want to do, not something the assistant is offering. MUST be a grammatically complete phrase: if it uses an adjective ("quarterly", "weekly"), include the noun it modifies ("quarterly review", "weekly sync"). Never end on a dangling modifier, preposition, or trailing "the/my/a". Prefer completeness over tightness when you have room under 40 chars.
- prompt: 1-2 natural sentences in the user's voice — what they'd type to the assistant. First-person about themselves (I/me/my), second-person to the assistant (you/your). Never refer to the user by name or in the third person, and never narrate what the assistant will do.
- category: one of ${CONVERSATION_STARTER_CATEGORIES.join(", ")}

## Constraints

**Voice**: The user clicks these chips to send a message to the assistant. Both the label AND the prompt must read as something the user is typing — first-person (I/me/my) about themselves, second-person (you/your) to the assistant. Never refer to the user by name or in the third person ("him", "her", "they", or their actual name) — that's the assistant's voice, not the user's. Never narrate what the assistant will do ("Let me check…", "I'll see what he's been up to…").

**Coherence**: The top 4 starters should feel like one set — similar abstraction level, no jarring mix of mundane chores and life strategy. The remaining 4 fallbacks may branch into adjacent topics.

**Diversity**: Each chip covers a distinct topic. Never two chips about the same tool, project, or theme. Across all 8 starters, avoid repeating topics.

**No setup chips**: Never include a chip whose primary meaning is configuration or "set up X for Y" unless it solves an urgent pain the user is actively feeling. Prefer the outcome over the mechanism.

**Natural language**: No jargon, project names, or raw memory phrases in labels unless they already sound natural in conversation. If a label sounds like a ticket title or backlog item, rewrite it as something the user would actually say.

## Examples

Bad → Good (ticket-speak → natural):
- "Fix Slack Socket Mode blocker" → "Fix Slack so it just works"
- "Restore outgoing Slack messages" → "Get Slack messages flowing"
- "Review this week's calendar" → "Protect this week's focus"
- "Set up a playbook for inbox" → "Triage my inbox"

Bad → Good (assistant voice → user voice):
- "You've got a busy week ahead" → "Plan my week ahead"
- "Let me check your calendar" → "Check my Thursday schedule"
- "Catch up with <user's own name> today" → "Catch me up today" (the user's own name becomes me/my/I, never "you"; third-party names like a colleague or friend stay as written)

Bad → Good (prompt in assistant's voice → prompt in user's voice):
- "It's Saturday morning and I haven't connected with <user's own name> yet. Let me see what they've been up to." → "Let's catch up this morning; can you help me sort through what matters today?" (assistant narrating about the user → user speaking to assistant; only the user's own name becomes me/my/I, names of other people are preserved)
- "<User's own name> has had a busy week — I should check in on how they're feeling." → "I've had a busy week — can we talk through how it went?"

Bad → Good (incomplete phrase → complete):
- "Prep for Friday's quarterly" → "Prep for Friday's quarterly review"
- "Finish the onboarding" → "Finish the onboarding guide"
- "Draft the release" → "Draft the release notes"`;
