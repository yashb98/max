 *     coalesces rapid threshold crossings into one.
 *   - `"idle"`: source conversation has been idle long enough to warrant a
 *     debounced analysis pass.
 *   - `"lifecycle"`: a conversation lifecycle transition (e.g. resume,
 *     close) should trigger a debounced analysis pass.
 *   - `"compaction"`: context was just compacted — some recent turns are
 *     now hidden behind a summary, so crystallize anything worth
 *     remembering before the window narrows further. Fires immediately
 *     (`runAfter = now`) like `"batch"`.

 *
 * Immediate triggers (`"batch"`, `"compaction"`) and debounced triggers
 * (`"idle"`, `"lifecycle"`) are written to separate rows keyed by a
 * `triggerGroup` discriminator. This prevents an idle enqueue from
 * pushing an already-scheduled batch row's `runAfter` into the future
 * (and vice versa). Within each group, rapid enqueues still coalesce to
 * a single pending row via `upsertAutoAnalysisJob`.
