/**
 * Idempotent migration to add indexes on llm_usage_events for the
 * time-range and breakdown queries the usage dashboard needs.
 *
 * - Covering index on (created_at) for efficient time-range scans.
 * - Composite index on (actor, created_at) for per-actor breakdowns.
 * - Composite index on (provider, model, created_at) for provider/model grouping.
 *
 * SUPERSEDED: The two composite indexes are dropped by migration 139.
 * They don't accelerate grouped queries — SQLite still uses temp B-trees
 * for GROUP BY regardless of index column order. Only the plain
 * created_at index (kept) provides value for range scans.
