/**
 * Roll back all completed memory (database) migrations with version > targetVersion.
 *
 * Iterates eligible migrations in reverse version order. For each:
 * 1. Marks the checkpoint as `"rolling_back"` for crash recovery.
 * 2. Calls `entry.down(database)` — each down() manages its own transactions.
 *    (`down` is required on `MigrationRegistryEntry` at the type level.)
 * 3. Deletes the checkpoint from `memory_checkpoints`.
 *
 * **Usage**: Pass the target version number you want to roll back *to*. All
 * migrations with a higher version number that have been applied will be
 * reversed. For example, `rollbackMemoryMigration(db, 5)` rolls back all
 * applied migrations with version > 5.
 *
 * **Checkpoint state**: Each rolled-back migration's checkpoint is deleted
 * from `memory_checkpoints`. If the process crashes mid-rollback, the
 * `"rolling_back"` marker is detected and cleared by
 * `recoverCrashedMigrations` on the next startup.
 *
 * **Warning — data loss**: Some down() migrations may not fully restore the
 * original state (e.g., DROP TABLE migrations recreate the table but cannot
 * recover the original data). Review each migration's down() implementation
 * before calling this function programmatically.
 *
 * **Important**: Stop the assistant before running rollbacks. Rolling back
 * migrations while the assistant is running may cause schema mismatches,
 * query failures, or data corruption.
 *
 * @param database  The Drizzle database instance.
 * @param targetVersion  Roll back to this version (exclusive — all migrations
 *   with version > targetVersion are reversed).
 * @returns The list of rolled-back migration keys.
