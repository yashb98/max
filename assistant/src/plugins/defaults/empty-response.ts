/**
 * Default `emptyResponse` plugin.
 *
 * The plugin's middleware is a passthrough — it calls `next(args)` and returns
 * the result unchanged. The actual decision lives in
 * {@link defaultEmptyResponseTerminal}, which is wired in as the pipeline's
 * `terminal` argument by the `runPipeline` call site in `agent/loop.ts`. This
 * separation matters: the default plugin is registered before any user plugin
 * (defaults load first in `bootstrapPlugins()`), which puts it at the
 * OUTERMOST position of the onion chain. If the default middleware were to
 * decide directly without calling `next`, it would shadow every
 * later-registered plugin. Routing through `next(args)` lets user middleware
 * participate normally.
 *
 * Wiring the terminal at the call site (rather than relying on the plugin to
 * be registered) also means the loop's nudge/accept/error behavior survives
 * configurations that boot without the default plugin — e.g. unit tests that
 * skip `bootstrapPlugins()`.
 *
 * The terminal inspects the turn snapshot and returns one of:
 *
 * 1. `"nudge"`  — the turn produced no visible text, no tool calls, follows
 *                 at least one prior tool-use turn, no earlier turn in this
 *                 run() has already delivered visible text, AND the retry
 *                 counter is below `maxEmptyResponseRetries`. The loop
 *                 appends `nudgeText` (the `<system_notice>…` message below)
 *                 as a `user` turn and re-queries the model.
 * 2. `"accept"` — every other case. The turn either legitimately ended
 *                 (model said its piece earlier), is still in progress
 *                 (tool calls pending), or exhausted its retry budget. The
 *                 loop pushes the assistant message and continues normally.
 *
 * The default never returns `"error"` — that action is an escape hatch for
 * downstream plugins (e.g. a circuit breaker) that want to surface an
 * explicit error instead of silently absorbing an empty turn.
 *
 * `MAX_EMPTY_RESPONSE_RETRIES` lives in `agent/loop.ts` and is threaded into
 * the pipeline via `EmptyResponseArgs.maxEmptyResponseRetries` so the cap is
 * declared in one place only.
