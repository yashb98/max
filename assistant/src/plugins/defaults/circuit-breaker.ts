/**
 * Default `circuitBreaker` plugin.
 *
 * Replicates the inline compaction circuit-breaker logic that previously
 * lived in `daemon/conversation-agent-loop.ts`: three consecutive summary-LLM
 * failures open the circuit for a one-hour cooldown, and any successful
 * compaction resets the counter.
 *
 * The plugin is a thin wrapper over the state container passed in
 * `CircuitBreakerArgs.state`. The {@link Conversation} owns the underlying
 * fields (`consecutiveCompactionFailures`, `compactionCircuitOpenUntil`)
 * because dev-only playground routes (`POST /playground/reset-compaction-circuit`,
 * `POST /playground/inject-compaction-failures`) read and mutate them
 * directly. Keeping ownership on the conversation lets this plugin stay a
 * pure wrapper while preserving those hatches.
 *
 * Semantics — query vs update:
 * - `{ key }` — query. Returns the current `{ open, cooldownRemainingMs? }`.
 * - `{ key, outcome }` — update state based on outcome, then return the
 *   post-update decision. A run of three failures trips the breaker; any
 *   non-failure outcome resets both the counter and the cooldown timestamp.
 *
 * Event emission — preserves the existing `trackCompactionOutcome` behavior:
 * - Emits `compaction_circuit_open` exactly once when the counter first
 *   reaches the threshold and the circuit is dormant (null or expired).
 * - Emits `compaction_circuit_closed` only on the open→closed transition.
 *   Successive successful outcomes while the circuit is already closed emit
 *   nothing (would otherwise spam the client).
 *
 * The `key` parameter is carried through for multi-circuit futures but the
 * default plugin currently bundles all circuit state into the `state`
 * container; the key is attached to the log record via the pipeline runner.
