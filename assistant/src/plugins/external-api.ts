/**
 * External plugin runtime — `globalThis.__vellumPluginRuntime` bridge.
 *
 * Workspace-local plugins (`<workspaceDir>/plugins/*`) get dynamic-imported by
 * {@link loadUserPlugins}. They need to call `registerPlugin()` from their
 * module body and they typically also want to read secrets, subscribe to
 * runtime events, etc.
 *
 * Importing those symbols by absolute path
 * (`/abs/path/to/assistant/src/plugins/registry.js`) works when the daemon is
 * running from source — both the daemon and the dynamic-imported plugin
 * resolve the same on-disk file and share module identity. It DOES NOT work
 * when the daemon is a `bun --compile` binary: the daemon's modules are baked
 * into the executable, and any absolute-path import re-loads a fresh disk
 * copy. `registerPlugin()` then writes into a disjoint registry instance and
 * the daemon never sees the plugin.
 *
 * The fix is to expose a single, stable handle on `globalThis` that plugins
 * read at module-load time. The daemon's bundled modules attach themselves
 * here once at startup; plugins consume the same instance regardless of how
 * the daemon was built.
 *
 * Plugins use the bridge like this:
 *
 *   const runtime = (globalThis as { __vellumPluginRuntime?: ... })
 *     .__vellumPluginRuntime;
 *   if (!runtime || runtime.version !== 1) throw new Error("...");
 *   const { registerPlugin, assistantEventHub, getSecureKeyAsync } = runtime;
 *
 * Type-only imports (`import type { Plugin } from "..."`) remain free to use
 * absolute paths or workspace-local copies — the TypeScript compiler erases
 * them and they have no module-identity effect at runtime.
 *
 * See `assistant/docs/plugins.md` for the full authoring contract and
 * `assistant/examples/plugins/echo/register.ts` for a worked example.

 *
 * The field set is intentionally small: the most-commonly-needed symbols
 * across both static (module-load-time) and dynamic (init-time) plugin
 * lifecycle. Plugins that need richer runtime state can still receive it
 * through {@link PluginInitContext} during `init()`.
