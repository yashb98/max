/**
 * Plugin registry with manifest validation.
 *
 * Host-compat negotiation lives in the plugin's `package.json`
 * `peerDependencies["@vellumai/plugin-api"]` semver range — the
 * external-plugin loader checks it against the assistant version at
 * load time. This module owns the rest of the manifest validation
 * contract: name/version presence, duplicate-name detection, and the
 * closed-registration latch that protects `bootstrapPlugins()` from
 * late-arriving registrations.
 *
 * Registration is order-preserving: {@link getRegisteredPlugins},
 * {@link getMiddlewaresFor}, and (secondarily) {@link getInjectors} all reflect
 * the order in which {@link registerPlugin} was called, which in turn
 * determines onion order for middleware composition in the pipeline runner.
 *
 * This module does not call `Plugin.init()` — that is the job of the
 * bootstrap (see PR 14). It also does not wire the registry into the daemon;
 * later PRs introduce consumers.
 *
 * Design doc: `.private/plans/agent-plugin-system.md` (PR 13).
