/**
 * Plugin core types.
 *
 * This file is scaffolding only — it defines the shape of the plugin system
 * without wiring any behavior. Later PRs in the `agent-plugin-system` plan
 * refine per-pipeline argument/result types (currently `unknown`-based
 * placeholders) and add the pipeline runner, registry, and bootstrap.
 *
 * The assistant composes behavior around a small set of named pipelines
 * (`turn`, `llmCall`, `toolExecute`, ...). Each plugin may contribute one
 * {@link Middleware} per pipeline; the registry composes them in onion
 * order at runtime. Plugins may also contribute {@link Injector}s that emit
 * system-prompt-time content, as well as model-visible capabilities
 * (`tools`, `routes`, `skills`).
 *
 * Design doc: `.private/plans/agent-plugin-system.md`.
