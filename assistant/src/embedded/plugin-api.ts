/**
 * Embedded handle for `@vellumai/plugin-api`.
 *
 * Standard `import * as pluginApi from "../plugin-api/index.ts"` lets Bun's
 * normal bundler walk the plugin-api module graph at build time — relative
 * imports inside plugin-api (`./types.js`, future runtime siblings) are
 * inlined naturally, with no separate build step. In `bun --compile`, this
 * means plugin-api ships as part of the assistant binary's regular code
 * graph; in JIT/Docker, it loads from source.
 *
 * The loaded namespace is then installed on `globalThis` under a versioned
 * symbol. The boot-time shim writer (`ensurePluginApiShim`) enumerates
 * {@link PLUGIN_API_EXPORTS} and generates a tiny ESM module at
 * `<workspaceDir>/node_modules/@vellumai/plugin-api/index.js` that
 * re-binds each runtime export from `globalThis`. User plugins that
 * `import { ... } from "@vellumai/plugin-api"` walk up to that shim and
 * pick up the bindings.
 *
 * Type-only exports erase before this module loads, so `Object.keys`
 * sees only runtime exports. That's correct — types are a dev-time
 * concern, resolved against plugin-api source via tsconfig path-mapping
 * (or, post-PR-5, against a generated `.d.ts` next to the runtime
 * shim).
