 * Bump stale `timeouts.providerStreamTimeoutSec: 300` to 1800.
 *
 * The schema default was raised from 300s (5 min) to 1800s (30 min) in
 * PR #22702, but users whose workspace config was written before that change
 * still carry an explicit 300 that overrides the new default, causing streams
 * to abort after 5 minutes with "Anthropic stream timed out after 300s".
