/**
 * Workspace migration 046: Remove legacy `workspace/hooks/` directory.
 *
 * Migration 022 moved `~/.vellum/hooks/` into `~/.vellum/workspace/hooks/`.
 * With the hook system entirely removed, that directory is dead state — it is
 * no longer read or written by the assistant. This migration deletes the
 * directory (and everything under it) so stale hook manifests, config, and
 * executables do not linger in user workspaces.
 *
 * Idempotent: safe to re-run after interruption. A no-op when the directory
 * is already absent.
