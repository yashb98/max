/**
 * Roll back workspace (filesystem) migrations in reverse order, stopping before
 * the target migration.
 *
 * Migrations after `targetMigrationId` in the registry array are reversed in
 * reverse order; the target migration itself is kept applied.
 *
 * **Usage**: Pass the full migrations array (typically `WORKSPACE_MIGRATIONS`
 * from `registry.ts`) and the ID of the migration you want to roll back *to*.
 * For example, `rollbackWorkspaceMigrations(dir, migrations, "010-app-dir-rename")`
 * rolls back all applied migrations that appear after `010-app-dir-rename` in
 * the registry.
 *
 * **Checkpoint state**: Each rolled-back migration's entry is deleted from the
 * `.workspace-migrations.json` checkpoint file. If the process crashes
 * mid-rollback, the `"rolling_back"` marker is detected and cleared by
 * `runWorkspaceMigrations` on the next startup (it re-runs interrupted
 * migrations).
 *
 * **Warning — data loss**: Every workspace migration must define a `down()`
 * method (enforced at the type level), but some rollbacks are lossy (e.g.,
 * file deletions or format conversions that discard the original cannot fully
 * restore prior state). Review each migration's `down()` implementation
 * before calling this function.
 *
 * **Important**: Stop the assistant before running rollbacks. Rolling back
 * workspace migrations while the assistant is running may cause file conflicts,
 * stale caches, or data corruption.
 *
 * @param workspaceDir  The workspace directory path (e.g., `~/.vellum/workspace`).
 * @param migrations  The full ordered array of workspace migrations (from `WORKSPACE_MIGRATIONS`).
 * @param targetMigrationId  The migration ID to roll back to (exclusive — all
 *   migrations after this one are reversed).
