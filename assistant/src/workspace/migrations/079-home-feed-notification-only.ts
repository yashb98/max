/**
 * Workspace migration `076-home-feed-notification-only`.
 *
 * Rewrites `<workspace>/data/home-feed.json` from the legacy v1 schema
 * (mixed `nudge | digest | action | thread` types with `source`,
 * `author`, `minTimeAway` fields) into the collapsed v2 schema (single
 * `notification` type, no source/author/minTimeAway).
 *
 * Behaviour:
 *   - Missing file → no-op.
 *   - Malformed JSON → log and no-op (daemon startup must never block;
 *     the writer's `readHomeFeed()` already treats unreadable files as
 *     empty so the next append cycle naturally rewrites a clean file).
 *   - Already v2 → no-op (idempotent).
 *   - v1 (or any non-v2 shape with an `items` array): drop entries
 *     whose `type !== "action"` (legacy nudge/digest/thread items have
 *     no v2 analogue and weren't surfaced as live notifications anyway,
 *     per PR 15 of the home-notif-feed-revamp plan); for kept entries
 *     drop `source` / `author` / `minTimeAway` and rewrite `type` to
 *     `"notification"`. Persist as `{ version: 2, items, updatedAt }`.
 *
 * Idempotent: running the migration a second time on a v2 file is a
 * no-op. The runner's checkpoint also skips re-runs, but this in-file
 * guard keeps the migration safe even if the checkpoint is wiped.
 *
 * `down()` is a no-op — the legacy v1 fields (`source`, `author`,
 * `minTimeAway`, the four item types) were dropped during the
 * forward migration and cannot be recovered. Rolling back to v1 from
 * v2 would also leave the writer producing a shape the older code
 * cannot parse, so a real rollback would require reverting the writer
 * code in lockstep.
