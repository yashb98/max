# Configuration Reference

All call-related settings can be managed via `assistant config`:

| `services.tts.provider`                     | Active TTS provider for speech synthesis. Must be a provider ID from the catalog (`elevenlabs`, `fish-audio`, `deepgram`, `xai`).

## TTS provider call-path behavior

Each TTS provider uses one of two call-path modes during phone calls:

| Provider     | Call mode          | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `elevenlabs` | `native-twilio`    | Text tokens are forwarded to Twilio's ConversationRelay, which synthesizes audio via its built-in ElevenLabs integration.                                                |
| `fish-audio` | `synthesized-play` | The assistant synthesizes audio server-side via Fish Audio's HTTP API and streams chunks to Twilio via play messages.                                                    |
| `deepgram`   | `synthesized-play` | The assistant synthesizes audio server-side via Deepgram's HTTP API and streams chunks to Twilio via play messages. Uses the same API key as Deepgram speech-to-text.    |
| `xai`        | `synthesized-play` | The assistant synthesizes audio server-side via xAI's HTTP API and streams chunks to Twilio via play messages. No native Twilio fallback (`allowNativeFallback: false`). |

Providers using `synthesized-play` add a small amount of latency compared to `native-twilio` because audio must be synthesized server-side before playback. The assistant handles chunk buffering and streaming automatically.

## Adjusting settings

```bash
# Increase max call duration to 2 hours
assistant config set calls.maxDurationSeconds 7200

# Disable AI disclosure (check local regulations first)
assistant config set calls.disclosure.enabled false

# Custom disclosure message
assistant config set calls.disclosure.text "Just so you know, this is an assistant calling on behalf of my human."

# Give more time for user consultation
assistant config set calls.userConsultTimeoutSeconds 300
```

# Call Quality Tips

When crafting tasks for the AI voice agent, follow these guidelines for the best call experience:

## Writing good task descriptions

- **Be specific about the objective**: "Make a dinner reservation for 2 at 7pm tonight" is better than "Call the restaurant"
- **Include relevant context**: Names, account numbers, appointment details - anything the agent might need
- **Specify what information to collect**: "Ask about their return policy and store hours" tells the agent what to gather
- **Set clear completion criteria**: The agent knows to end the call when the task is fulfilled

## Providing context

The `context` field is powerful - use it to give the agent background that helps it sound natural:

- User's name and identifying details (for making appointments, verifying accounts)
- Preferences and constraints (dietary restrictions, budget limits, scheduling conflicts)
- Previous interaction history ("I called last week and spoke with Sarah about...")
- Special instructions ("If they put you on hold for more than 5 minutes, hang up and we'll try again later")

## Things the AI voice agent handles well

**Outbound calls:**

- Making reservations and appointments
- Checking business hours, availability, or pricing
- Confirming or rescheduling existing appointments
- Gathering information (store policies, product availability)
- Simple customer service interactions
- Leaving voicemails (it will speak the message if voicemail picks up)

**Inbound calls:**

- Answering as a receptionist and routing caller requests to the user via ASK_GUARDIAN
- Taking messages when the user is unavailable
- Answering questions the assistant already knows from memory/context
- Screening calls with guardian voice verification

## Things to be aware of

- Calls have a maximum duration (configurable via `calls.maxDurationSeconds`, default: 1 hour)
- The agent gives a 2-minute warning before the time limit
- Emergency numbers (911, 112, 999, etc.) are blocked and cannot be called
- The AI disclosure setting (`calls.disclosure.enabled`) controls whether the agent announces it's an AI at the start of the call
