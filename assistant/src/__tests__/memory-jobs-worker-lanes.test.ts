/**
 * Head-of-line repro for the per-lane scheduler in `runMemoryJobsOnce`.
 *
 * Before this fix, all non-embed jobs ran through a single bounded worker
 * pool, so a long-running `graph_consolidate` LLM call would pin every slot
 * and starve fast-lane jobs (e.g. `memory_v2_activation_recompute`)
 * for the duration of that call.
 *
 * The new scheduler runs slow / fast / embed lanes in parallel pools, each
 * with its own concurrency budget. This test enqueues a wave of slow LLM
 * jobs alongside fast jobs and asserts that every fast job completes before
 * any slow job's promise resolves — proving the lanes are truly independent.
