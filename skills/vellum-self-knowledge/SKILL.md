## Critical Rule

**Never answer from memory or general knowledge about Vellum.** Always go to a source of truth.
This skill contains zero static information — only pointers to where the truth lives.

## Sources of Truth

### 1. The `assistant` CLI — Live Runtime State

The CLI is the single source of truth for anything about the running assistant's current state.

| Question type                       | Command                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Current model, provider, config     | `assistant config get llm`                                                 |

| API keys                            | `assistant keys list`                                                      |
| MCP servers                         | `assistant mcp list`                                                       |
| Watchers                            | `assistant watchers list`                                                  |
| Token usage/costs                   | `assistant usage totals` / `assistant usage breakdown --group-by provider` |
| Version                             | `assistant --version`                                                      |

Run `assistant --help` or `assistant <command> --help` to discover more.

### 3. Source Code — Deep Implementation Details

For questions the docs and CLI can't answer (internal architecture, how a specific feature is implemented, source-level details):

1. Get the current version: `assistant --version`
2. The open source repo is at `https://github.com/vellum-ai/vellum-assistant`
3. The release for version X is at `https://github.com/vellum-ai/vellum-assistant/releases/tag/vX.Y.Z`
4. Check out the matching tag locally: `cd /workspace/vellum-assistant && git fetch --tags && git checkout v<version>`
5. Key source locations:
   - `assistant/` — Runtime (conversation loop, tool dispatch, memory, scheduling)
   - `gateway/` — Ingress boundary (webhooks, Telegram, Twilio, reverse proxy)
   - `clients/` — Native macOS client
   - `skills/` — Bundled skill definitions
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md` — Cross-system index
   - `assistant/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Runtime internals
   - `gateway/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Gateway internals
   - `assistant/docs/architecture/` — Detailed architecture docs (security, memory, etc.)
6. Read the relevant source files to answer the question.

### Resolution Order

1. **CLI first** — if the question is about current state, config, or capabilities, the CLI has it.
2. **Docs second** — if the question is conceptual ("what is X", "how does Y work"), fetch the docs page.
3. **Source code last** — only for deep implementation questions that the docs don't cover.
