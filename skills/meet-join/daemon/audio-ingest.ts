/**
 * MeetAudioIngest — daemon-side audio ingress for a meet-bot container.
 *
 * Flow:
 *   1. The session manager calls {@link MeetAudioIngest.start} before the
 *      bot container is spawned. `start()` opens a Unix-domain-socket server
 *      (the bot connects as the client once it boots) and opens a streaming
 *      STT session via the configured provider (resolved from
 *      `services.stt.provider`).
 *   2. When the bot connects to the socket, its raw PCM frames are forwarded
 *      byte-for-byte to the streaming transcriber.
 *   3. The transcriber's `partial` / `final` transcript events are wrapped
 *      in a {@link TranscriptChunkEvent} and dispatched through
 *      {@link MeetSessionEventRouter} keyed by `meetingId`.
 *   4. On session teardown, {@link MeetAudioIngest.stop} closes the
 *      streaming session, tears down the socket server, and unlinks the
 *      socket file.
 *
 * Timeouts:
 *   - If the bot has not connected within {@link BOT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS},
 *     `start()` rejects. The session manager treats this as a join failure
 *     so we do not leave a zombie container running against a dead ingest.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *   - The STT provider is resolved at runtime via the `SkillHost` injected
 *     into {@link createAudioIngest}. That factory reads
 *     `services.stt.provider` through the host and looks up credentials
 *     through the provider catalog. Meet transcription therefore honors
 *     the same provider selection as the rest of the assistant.
 *   - Provider-specific options (e.g. Deepgram's `smartFormatting` /
 *     `interimResults`) are owned by each provider's config schema.
 *   - All external dependencies (transcriber factory, socket listener) are
 *     swapped via constructor-level factories so tests can drive the class
 *     without touching real sockets or a real STT provider account.
 *   - This file has zero `assistant/` imports — every runtime dependency
 *     arrives via the {@link SkillHost} contract from
 *     `@vellumai/skill-host-contracts`.
