 * In-skill registry for meet-join sub-module factories.
 *
 * Each sub-module (`audio-ingest`, `speaker-resolver`, `tts-bridge`, …)
 * exposes a host-accepting factory of the shape `(host: SkillHost) => T`
 * and registers it here at module-import time via
 * {@link registerSubModule}. The session manager resolves them back by
 * name through {@link getSubModule}, which keeps `register.ts` from
 * having to know about every sub-module's builder signature.
 *
 * ## Isolation rule
 *
 * This module is dependency-free on `assistant/`. `SkillHost` comes
 * from `@vellumai/skill-host-contracts`, the neutral package that
 * defines the host contract. Adding any `assistant/` import here
 * would defeat the purpose of the refactor.
