/**
 * MeetTtsBridge — streams synthesized speech from the configured TTS
 * provider into the Meet-bot's `/play_audio` endpoint.
 *
 * High-level flow per `speak()` call:
 *
 *   1. Allocate an opaque `streamId` (UUID v4).
 *   2. Resolve the configured TTS provider via the injected factory and
 *      invoke `provider.synthesizeStream({ text, voiceId, … }, onChunk)`.
 *      The provider emits audio in its own native format (mp3, wav, pcm at
 *      various sample rates) — the bridge does not assume 48 kHz s16le.
 *   3. Spawn a single ffmpeg child per call that transcodes whatever the
 *      provider emits into the bot's expected contract: raw 48 kHz / mono /
 *      16-bit signed little-endian PCM. Provider chunks are written into
 *      ffmpeg's stdin; ffmpeg's stdout is the body stream consumed by the
 *      outbound HTTP POST.
 *   4. POST `ffmpeg.stdout` to
 *      `${botUrl}/play_audio?stream_id=${streamId}&utterance_id=${utteranceId}`
 *      with `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` using chunked transfer.
 *      Because Node/undici require it for streamed upload bodies, the fetch
 *      is called with `duplex: "half"`.
 *   5. On abort (via `cancel(streamId)`): abort the outbound HTTP request,
 *      kill the ffmpeg child, and best-effort hit
 *      `DELETE /play_audio/${streamId}` so the bot can flush any buffered
 *      audio and play silence in its place.
 *
 * The bridge intentionally keeps the TTS provider contract behind a local
 * structural interface ({@link TtsProvider}) that mirrors the assistant's
 * provider shape — production wiring via {@link createTtsBridge} resolves
 * real providers through `host.providers.tts.*`, and tests inject fakes
 * that conform to the same local shape.

 * fetch doesn't resolve the outer `Response` until the server consumes the
 * full body. That means awaiting the fetch itself blocks for the entire
 * utterance duration — untenable for the tool call. The historical

 * container died between join and speak (e.g. Docker Desktop killing the
 * container, an orphan-reaper sweep, the user stopping it manually), the
 * POST rejected with `MEET_TTS_BOT_UNREACHABLE` ~1s later — but `speak()`
 * had already returned a valid-looking `streamId` so the agent recorded the
 * tool call as successful and moved on. The user heard silence and had no
 * signal that the tool had failed.
 *
 * Racing the POST's completion against this short window lets us catch the
 * common connect-level failures without paying their cost on the happy
 * path: a successful POST either resolves within the window (short

 *
 * Why the explicit output `-ar 48000` matters:
 *
 *   Provider voices ship at a variety of native sample rates — ElevenLabs
 *   mp3 at 22.05 kHz or 44.1 kHz, Fish Audio wav at 44.1 kHz, Deepgram

 *   so any rate mismatch would render as chipmunk/slowed audio in the
 *   meeting. ffmpeg resamples to the output `-ar` (via libswresample), and
 *   `-ac 1` downmixes to mono so stereo voices don't get interleaved-
 *   sample-as-time-domain corruption when pacat reads them as mono.
 *
 *   Keeping `-ar 48000 -ac 1` on the OUTPUT side (post `-i`) is what makes
 *   the resample/downmix happen — if these flags were on the input side,
 *   they would be interpreted as "assume the input is already this rate"
 *   (useful only for headerless raw PCM), which is exactly the chipmunk
 *   bug we're guarding against.
