/**
 * DockerRunner — thin typed wrapper over the Docker Engine HTTP API exposed
 * via the unix socket at `/var/run/docker.sock`.
 *
 * Used by `MeetSessionManager` to spawn per-meeting Meet-bot containers. The
 * CLI (`cli/src/lib/docker.ts`) drives Docker via the `docker` binary for
 * service orchestration; that pattern is not reused here because the runner
 * lives inside the assistant process where shelling out to `docker` adds a
 * dependency on the host PATH, forks an extra process per call, and blocks
 * on stdio. The HTTP-socket API keeps everything in-process, returns
 * structured JSON, and avoids the PATH/CLI surface entirely. See
 * `cli/src/lib/docker.ts` for the broader service container lifecycle.
 *
 * Mode-awareness (Phase 1.10 — Docker-in-Docker):
 *   - In bare-metal mode the daemon writes workspace artifacts to host paths
 *     it can share with sibling bot containers via standard Docker bind
 *     mounts on the host's Docker engine.
 *   - In Docker mode the daemon container ships its own `dockerd` (started
 *     by the init supervisor). The socket at `/var/run/docker.sock` now
 *     points at that inner `dockerd` rather than the host engine. Because
 *     the daemon's `/workspace` is a regular directory from inner
 *     `dockerd`'s point of view, workspace-rooted mounts collapse to simple
 *     host-path binds — same shape as bare-metal, just rooted at the
 *     daemon-internal workspace path (typically `/workspace`). No volume-
 *     name discovery, no subpath Mounts.
 *
 * Networking:
 *   - We always attach `host.docker.internal:host-gateway` via
 *     `HostConfig.ExtraHosts` so the bot can reach the daemon HTTP port in
 *     either mode. On Docker Desktop it's already mapped; on Linux (and in
 *     inner `dockerd` on the managed platform) the explicit gateway alias
 *     is required. In Docker mode the alias resolves to the inner bridge
 *     gateway, which routes back to the daemon process in the same
 *     container.

/**
 * Sweep orphaned meet-bot containers left behind by a crashed prior run.
 *
 * **Label scheme.** Every meet-bot container created by this daemon is
 * tagged at `/containers/create` time with three Docker labels:
 *
 *   - `vellum.meet.bot=true` — identifies the container as a meet-bot
 *     managed by this codebase (distinguishes from any other containers
 *     the user might be running).
 *   - `vellum.meet.meetingId=<id>` — carries the originating meeting ID
 *     so the reaper can match each labeled container against the currently-
 *     active in-process session set and only kill the ones that belong to
 *     no live session.
 *   - `vellum.meet.instance=<hash>` — scopes the container to a specific
 *     daemon instance root (see {@link getMeetBotInstanceHash}). The reaper
 *     refuses to touch containers whose hash differs so a second daemon
 *     pointed at a different instance root (common on developer machines
 *     with prod/dev/test/local instances side-by-side) cannot cross-kill
 *     another instance's live bots.
 *
 * **Filter semantics.** The reaper lists candidates filtered at the Docker
 * API layer by `vellum.meet.bot=true` only — not by the instance label.
 * This is deliberate: we need to *observe* pre-label containers (from a
 * version before this change shipped) so we can skip them and log a
 * breadcrumb, rather than silently hide them behind an API filter. Same-
 * instance + different-instance + unlabeled branching happens in code.
 *
 * **Kill protocol.** Each orphan receives a `SIGTERM`, then after a
 * {@link REAPER_TERM_KILL_GRACE_MS}-ms grace window the reaper issues a
 * `SIGKILL` as the hard fallback. Both calls go through the docker client's
 * `/kill` endpoint so the container's exit is recorded in the engine's
 * state table; the subsequent `docker events` stream fires normally and
 * downstream consumers (monitoring, log retention) see a clean shutdown
 * rather than a disappearing container. Per-container errors are caught and
 * logged so one misbehaving container can't abort the sweep.
 *
 * @param opts.docker Docker client — typically a {@link DockerRunner}.
 * @param opts.activeMeetingIds Meeting IDs that currently map to a live
 *   in-process session. Accepts either a static set or a zero-arg getter;
 *   the getter is consulted per-container so a join that lands mid-sweep
 *   is observed before its container is evaluated.
 * @param opts.instanceHash The current daemon instance's hash (from
 *   {@link getMeetBotInstanceHash}). Required — not optional — so callers
 *   cannot accidentally widen the sweep to all instances on the host.
 *   Containers whose `vellum.meet.instance` label doesn't match go into
 *   `kept`; containers missing the label go into `skippedUnlabeled`.
 * @param opts.createdBefore Optional Unix-epoch-seconds cutoff. Containers
 *   with `Created >= createdBefore` are kept unconditionally. Pass the
 *   daemon's start time during the startup sweep so new joins launched
 *   concurrently can never be misidentified as orphans from a prior run.
 * @param opts.logger Structured logger — one INFO line per kill.
 * @returns Summary of which container ids were killed, kept, or skipped as
 *   unlabeled. `skippedUnlabeled` is observability-only — pre-label
 *   containers are never reaped because they might belong to another
 *   installation; users upgrading with a stale unlabeled container must
