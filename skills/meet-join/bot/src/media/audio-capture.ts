/**
 * Audio capture for the meet-bot.
 *
 * Spawns `parec` against the `meet_capture.monitor` Pulse source (set up by
 * `pulse-setup.sh` in PR 5), chunks the raw PCM stream into fixed-size
 * frames, and writes those frames into a TCP socket whose server end is
 * opened by the daemon (`MeetAudioIngest`) on the host loopback interface.
 * The bot dials `host.docker.internal:<port>` to reach it.
 *
 * TCP (rather than a Unix-domain socket over a bind mount) is required
 * because Docker Desktop on macOS exposes the socket file through its
 * VirtioFS/gRPC-FUSE layer but the kernel rejects `connect()` with
 * `EOPNOTSUPP` — so Unix sockets across the host↔VM mount boundary work
 * on Linux only. Loopback TCP traverses `host.docker.internal` cleanly on
 * every platform the bot runs on.
 *
 * Defaults are tuned for Deepgram's realtime STT: s16le mono 16kHz with
 * 20ms frames (320 bytes = 160 samples * 2 bytes). Callers can override the
 * rate/frame size for other consumers (e.g. Whisper streaming).
 *
 * Transient failures — `parec` crashing, the socket dropping, the daemon
 * not yet listening — are absorbed with a bounded retry loop. After 3
 * consecutive failed attempts to re-establish the pipeline we surface the
 * accumulated error via `stop()`'s rejection (and via the optional
 * `onError` callback for async observation).
 *
 * The implementation is structured around injectable `spawn` / `connect`
 * factories so the unit tests can exercise the chunking, reconnect, and
 * error paths without shelling out to a real `parec` or opening a real
 * socket. The defaults point at `Bun.spawn` + `net.createConnection`.
