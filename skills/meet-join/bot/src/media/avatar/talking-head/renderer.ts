/**
 * TalkingHead.js-backed avatar renderer for the meet-bot.
 *
 * TalkingHead.js (`@met4citizen/talkinghead` on npm) renders a Ready
 * Player Me GLB avatar in a WebGL/three.js canvas and drives lip-sync
 * from viseme events. Because TalkingHead.js requires a real browser
 * runtime (three.js needs a `<canvas>`, a WebGL context, and an
 * `AnimationFrame` loop), the renderer itself lives **inside a second
 * Chrome tab** inside the meet-bot's Chrome process, not in the
 * bot's Node runtime.
 *
 * Responsibilities of this bot-side renderer:
 *
 * 1. On `start()`: send `avatar.start` over the native-messaging bridge
 *    to the meet-controller extension. The extension opens the avatar
 *    tab (see `meet-controller-ext/src/features/avatar.ts`) and replies
 *    with `avatar.started` once the tab has mounted.
 *
 *    We bound the wait for that ack with a configurable timeout
 *    (default 5 s). On timeout we throw
 *    {@link AvatarRendererUnavailableError} so the session-manager can
 *    fall back to the noop renderer without crashing the meeting.
 *
 * 2. On `pushViseme(event)`: forward the event to the extension as
 *    `avatar.push_viseme`. The extension relays the event into the
 *    avatar tab via `chrome.tabs.sendMessage`.
 *
 * 3. On inbound `avatar.frame` from the extension: base64-decode the
 *    payload. If the frame is JPEG, transcode it to Y4M via a
 *    short-lived ffmpeg child; if it's already Y4M, emit the bytes
 *    directly. Downstream: {@link attachDeviceWriter} forwards the
 *    Y4M bytes to `/dev/video10`.
 *
 * 4. On `stop()`: send `avatar.stop`, tear down the ffmpeg child, and
 *    dispose the native-messaging channel so late frames after
 *    shutdown are dropped at the channel layer. Idempotent.
 *
 * ## Audio / viseme handling
 *
 * TalkingHead.js lip-syncs from discrete viseme events. This renderer
 * advertises `{ needsVisemes: true, needsAudio: true }`:
 *
 * - Incoming viseme events are BUFFERED by the renderer and only
 *   forwarded to the extension once the audio-playback clock catches
 *   up to each viseme's declared `timestamp`. This removes visible
 *   drift caused by network jitter between the daemon and the bot:
 *   a viseme that arrives 100ms before its audio lands is held until
 *   the audio actually plays, then released.
 * - `notifyPlaybackTimestamp(ts)` advances the internal playback
 *   clock. The bot's HTTP server wires the audio-playback handle's
 *   `onPlaybackTimestamp` stream to this method so every PCM write
 *   into `bot_out` bumps the renderer's clock forward.
 * - `pushAudio` is accepted for interface conformance but is a no-op.
 *   The renderer derives all timing information from the
 *   playback-timestamp stream, not from direct audio chunks.
 *
 * ## Frame transcoding
 *
 * JPEG → Y4M conversion runs through a short-lived ffmpeg child per
 * frame. This is the simplest correct implementation — the frame is
 * written to ffmpeg's stdin, Y4M is read off its stdout, and the child
 * exits. It's also the slowest: a sustained stream at 24 fps spawns
 * 24 subprocesses per second which is inefficient. A future
 * optimization is to keep a long-lived ffmpeg child with a persistent
 * Y4M input stream; we defer that complexity to a later PR because:
 *
 * - v1 ships at 20–24 fps, which is still well under the 30 fps
 *   device-writer cap and well within what per-frame spawning can
 *   sustain on a modest bot VM.
 * - The alignment math PR 9 introduces may change the frame-ingress
 *   contract entirely; premature optimization would be wasted work.
 *
 * The Y4M-input path skips ffmpeg entirely — the extension may
 * eventually capture raw Y4M via a future `canvas.captureStream()`
 * → MediaRecorder pipeline. v1 always uses JPEG.
 *
 * ## Why a second tab?
 *
 * We can't host TalkingHead.js in the Meet tab itself — Meet's CSP
 * and its aggressive DOM virtualization would fight with three.js.
 * Running it in a pinned, inactive second tab isolates it: the user
 * never sees the tab (it lives on the Xvfb virtual display), but
 * Chrome still budgets it real GPU time as long as the extension
 * marks it `pinned` to avoid tab-discard.
