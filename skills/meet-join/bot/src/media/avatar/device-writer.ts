/**
 * Device writer — pipes an {@link AvatarRenderer}'s Y4M frames into an
 * open {@link VideoDeviceHandle}.
 *
 * Subscribes to the renderer's `onFrame` channel on `start()`. Each
 * arriving frame is rate-limited against a configurable max-FPS cap
 * (default 30 FPS) and then forwarded to the device handle's `sink`.
 * The cap exists because hosted backends (Simli, HeyGen, Tavus) can
 * burst frames faster than the v4l2 ring can consume them — flooding
 * the device risks dropped frames and, in some kernel versions,
 * full-speed buffer overrun errors on the consumer side.
 *
 * Stopping is idempotent: repeated `stop()` calls settle without
 * throwing. `stop()` unsubscribes the renderer listener before
 * returning so a late frame delivered after shutdown cannot reach the
 * sink.
 *
 * This module owns no actual v4l2 configuration — the device handle
 * (`openVideoDevice` from `../video-device.ts`) already negotiated the
 * pixel format. The writer is just the glue between the renderer's
 * frame channel and the kernel-side sink.
