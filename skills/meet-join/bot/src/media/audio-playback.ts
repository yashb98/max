/**
 * Audio playback for the meet-bot.
 *
 * Spawns `pacat --playback` against the `bot_out` Pulse null-sink (set up by
 * `pulse-setup.sh`); Chrome's microphone is wired to `bot_out.monitor`, so
 * any PCM we push into pacat's stdin shows up as the bot's voice inside the
 * Meet tab.
 *
 * Public surface:
 *   - `startAudioPlayback()` — idempotent. Returns a writable handle. If a
 *     previous pacat is still alive, the same handle is returned so
 *     concurrent playback calls don't fight over who spawned the process.
 *   - `stopAudioPlayback()` — closes the current handle, kills pacat, and
 *     resets the module-level singleton. Safe to call repeatedly.
 *   - `flushSilence(ms)` — writes `ms * bytesPerMs` zero-valued bytes into
 *     the active handle. Used to cleanly terminate a stream without the
 *     characteristic "pop" caused by a sudden cut-off.
 *
 * Defaults match what the daemon sends: s16le mono 48kHz. That rate is
 * chosen to match Meet's WebRTC pipeline so the null-sink resampler has no
 * work to do.
 *
 * Like `audio-capture`, the module accepts an injected `spawn` factory so
 * tests can exercise ordering, cancellation, and silence-flush behavior
 * without ever shelling out to a real `pacat`. The default factory calls
 * `Bun.spawn`.
