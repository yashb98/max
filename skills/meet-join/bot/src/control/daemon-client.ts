/**
 * Bot → daemon event publisher.
 *
 * Buffers `MeetBotEvent`s produced by the scrapers/lifecycle emitters and
 * ships them to the daemon's ingress endpoint
 * (`POST /v1/internal/meet/:meetingId/events`) in small batches. Batching
 * amortizes HTTP overhead without introducing perceptible delay — the flush
 * triggers on whichever comes first of:
 *
 *   - `MAX_BATCH_SIZE` queued events, or
 *   - `FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS` since the first unflushed enqueue.
 *
 * Transient network / 5xx failures are retried with exponential backoff
 * (3 attempts, 250/500/1000ms). A 4xx is treated as a caller bug and
 * surfaced to the `onError` hook without retrying — the daemon has
 * rejected the payload, so retransmitting the same bytes is pointless.
 *
 * The fetch implementation is injected so tests can assert on calls
 * without hitting the network. In production the default is `globalThis.fetch`.
 *
 * ## Wire shape
 *
 * The daemon's ingress route in PR 9 decodes the request body as
 * `MeetBotEvent[]` — a bare JSON array, not an object wrapper. We match
 * that shape here so the two sides stay interoperable.
