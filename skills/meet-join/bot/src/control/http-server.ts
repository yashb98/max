/**
 * HTTP control surface for the meet-bot container.
 *
 * Exposes a small Hono app that the assistant daemon talks to:
 *
 *   - `GET  /health`                  — liveness/health probe (also used by Docker HEALTHCHECK).
 *   - `GET  /status`                  — full lifecycle snapshot.
 *   - `POST /leave`                   — ask the bot to leave the meeting.
 *   - `POST /send_chat`               — post a chat message into the Meet chat panel.
 *   - `POST /play_audio`              — stream raw PCM into pacat (Phase 3).
 *   - `DELETE /play_audio/:streamId`  — cancel an in-flight playback (barge-in).
 *   - `POST /avatar/enable`           — start the configured avatar renderer, wire its frames to `/dev/video10`, then flip the Meet camera toggle ON via the camera channel.
 *   - `POST /avatar/disable`          — flip the Meet camera toggle OFF (before renderer teardown to avoid a brief black frame), then tear down the renderer + detach the device writer.
 *   - `POST /avatar/viseme`           — forward a viseme event into the active renderer (no-op when disabled).
 *
 * Every mutating route validates its body against the corresponding Zod
 * schema from the contracts barrel so command shapes stay in sync with
 * the daemon side of the wire protocol.
 *
 * Auth: every route (including `/health`, so the probe matches production)
 * requires a `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header matching the `apiToken`
 * injected at construction time. The token is provisioned per meeting by the
 * daemon and passed to the container via environment variable.
