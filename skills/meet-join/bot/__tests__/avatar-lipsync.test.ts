/**
 * Lip-sync alignment tests for the TalkingHead.js renderer.
 *
 * The renderer is responsible for buffering inbound viseme events and
 * only forwarding them to the extension when the audio-playback clock
 * catches up to each viseme's declared timestamp. This prevents visible
 * drift when the network between the daemon and the bot delays visemes:
 * a viseme that arrives 100ms ahead of its corresponding audio is held
 * until the audio actually plays out of `bot_out`, then released.
 *
 * These tests exercise that behavior end-to-end against the real
 * {@link TalkingHeadRenderer} + real {@link startAudioPlayback}
 * pipeline (the pacat subprocess is a shim), with a fake
 * {@link AvatarNativeMessagingSender} capturing the downstream
 * `avatar.push_viseme` frames the extension would have received. We
 * drive the audio-playback handle with deterministic byte writes +
 * a controllable `now()` clock so the playback-timestamp stream is
 * fully observable and the test is not flaky on machine load.
 *
 * Coverage:
 *   - Visemes that arrive AHEAD of audio are held until the
 *     audio-playback timestamp catches up, then flushed in order.
 *   - Visemes that arrive LATE (after audio already passed their
 *     declared time) are flushed immediately — no "ghost" delay.
 *   - The renderer's `currentPlaybackTimestamp` is monotonic; a
 *     stale/out-of-order timestamp notification is ignored rather
 *     than rewinding the clock.
 *   - A `stop()` clears the buffer so visemes queued for a
 *     terminated session do not leak into a later one.
