/**
 * Centralized Google Meet DOM selectors.
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for every CSS/attribute selector
 * the meet-controller extension uses to interact with Google Meet's web UI.
 * Consolidating them here means that when Meet's DOM drifts (which happens
 * frequently, often without warning) we only need to patch this one file and
 * refresh the HTML fixtures under `__tests__/fixtures/`.
 *
 * ## Consumers
 *
 * The selectors are consumed by the extension's content script (`src/content.ts`
 * and the `src/features/*` modules), which runs in Meet's page world and reads
 * the live DOM directly via `document.querySelector*`. This replaces the
 * previous Playwright-driven browser-side helpers that lived in the meet-bot
 * package — those helpers and their selectors have been retired in favor of a
 * Manifest V3 content script that operates on the same page in-process.
 *
 * ## Conventions
 *
 * - Prefer stable attributes (ARIA, role, data-*) over class names or positional
 *   CSS selectors. Class names in Meet are frequently minified and change across
 *   releases; aria-labels and roles are comparatively stable because they are
 *   part of Google's accessibility contract.
 * - Where a stable attribute is not available, fall back to a descriptive
 *   selector and tag the constant with `// TODO(meet-dom)`. These are the
 *   candidates most likely to break on the next Meet refresh and should be
 *   re-verified each time fixtures are recaptured.
 * - Every selector MUST be exercised by a fixture in `__tests__/selectors.test.ts`.
 *   If a new selector is added without a matching fixture assertion, the test
 *   suite will fail.
 *
 * ## Downstream consumers (inside this package)
 *
 * - `src/features/join.ts` — prejoin surface selectors
 * - `src/features/participants.ts` — participant panel selectors
 * - `src/features/speaker.ts` — active-speaker indicator
 * - `src/features/chat.ts` — chat panel selectors
 *
 * See `skills/meet-join/bot/README.md` § "Refreshing Meet DOM fixtures" for
 * the manual refresh process. (That documentation will relocate alongside the
 * extension when the bot's README is rewritten later in the migration.)

/**
 * ISO-date string marking when the committed fixtures were captured.
 *
 * When a human developer refreshes the fixture HTML files from a live Meet

 * lets us trace any fixture vs. production mismatch to a concrete date and
 * decide whether to recapture.

   * racing step 6's consent post against a DOM that doesn't yet have the
   * chat composer:
   *
   *   - `LEAVE_BUTTON` (`button[aria-label="Leave call"]`) renders in BOTH
   *     the waiting-room UI and the in-meeting UI. Using it makes
   *     `waitForSelector` resolve the moment the bot clicks "Ask to join",
   *     before the host has admitted it.
   *   - `MIC_TOGGLE` (`"Turn off microphone"` / `"Turn on microphone"`)
   *     renders on the **prejoin lobby** too: Meet shows a fully-wired
   *     device-preview toolbar with the same dual aria-label on the
   *     pre-admission screen. `waitForSelector(MIC_TOGGLE)` therefore
   *     resolves synchronously on the lobby DOM — before the bot has
   *     even clicked "Ask to join" — and step 5 short-circuits so hard
   *     that `onAdmitted` fires while the bot is still sitting on the
   *     lobby. Step 6 then tries to post consent into a DOM that has
   *     no chat panel button at all, and the `[ext] consent post failed:
   *     chat input not found` diagnostic is the first sign anything
   *     went wrong.
   *
   * We use the chat / participants panel toggles instead. Both are
   * bottom-toolbar buttons that Meet mounts only once the user is
   * actually in the meeting — they do not render on the prejoin lobby
   * (which only shows device-preview controls) or in the waiting room
   * (which shows only the leave button and an "asking to be let in"
   * label). Matching either one guarantees the in-meeting toolbar has
   * mounted and that step 6's `ensurePanelOpen` will find `PANEL_BUTTON`
   * in the DOM a beat later.
   *
   * This lives as a dedicated constant (not an alias for `PANEL_BUTTON`)
   * so future DOM drift can move the signal to a different post-
   * admission-only element without changing the join flow's call site,
   * and so the OR-list can fail over to `"Show everyone"` if Meet ever
   * renames / hides the chat toggle (e.g. "continuous chat is turned
   * off" host configurations).
