/**
 * DOM wait helpers for the content script.
 *
 * The meet-controller extension runs inside Meet's page world as a Manifest V3
 * content script — it does not have access to Playwright-style `waitForSelector`
 * APIs. These helpers replicate the small subset of that behavior the join /
 * chat flows need, implemented on top of `MutationObserver` so they work in
 * any browser context without extra dependencies.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *
 *   - Every wait checks the document synchronously once before attaching an
 *     observer; this keeps the happy path (the element is already in the DOM)
 *     cheap and avoids racing against the first mutation.
 *   - The observer is always disconnected before the returned promise settles,
 *     whether the wait succeeded, timed out, or was rejected by an internal
 *     failure. Leaking observers on a Meet page is expensive because the DOM
 *     mutates constantly.
 *   - Errors use a stable message shape (`"timeout waiting for " + selector`)
 *     so the caller can build descriptive diagnostics without having to match
 *     on regex.
 *   - A `document`-scoped argument is exposed so tests can substitute a JSDOM
 *     document; production callers use the real `document` default.
 *   - The optional `interactable` filter gates resolution on the element being
 *     user-interactable, not merely present. Meet keeps hidden template and
 *     transition nodes in the tree (e.g. during prejoin → in-meeting
 *     transitions); a raw `querySelector` can match one before it becomes
 *     clickable, which then makes the join flow click the wrong path and
 *     time out in admission. The filter rejects elements that are explicitly
 *     marked hidden (via `hidden` / `aria-hidden="true"` on self or ancestor,
 *     or inline `display: none` / `visibility: hidden` / `pointer-events:
 *     none`). When available it also defers to `Element.checkVisibility()`
 *     for the layout-aware cases (opacity, content-visibility, off-screen
 *     offsetParent) — jsdom has no layout engine, so we fall back to the
 *     attribute/style checks alone in tests.
 */

/**
 * Return `true` when `el` looks user-interactable, `false` when it's a hidden
 * template/transition node that happens to match a selector.
 *
 * Conservative: only filters out elements that are *demonstrably* hidden via
 * explicit attributes, inline styles, or the native visibility check. Elements
 * that merely lack positive evidence of being interactable (common in jsdom,
 * where there is no layout) pass through.
 *
 * Exported for reuse by callers that need to apply the same filter to their
 * own imperative `querySelectorAll` loops (e.g. `features/join.ts` step 4
 * admission polling).
