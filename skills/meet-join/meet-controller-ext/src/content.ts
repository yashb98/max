/**
 * Meet content-script entry.
 *
 * Runs in the Google Meet page world at `document_idle`. Listens for
 * {@link BotToExtensionMessage} frames forwarded by the background
 * service worker's native-messaging bridge, drives the Meet prejoin UI
 * on `join`, and runs per-meeting feature modules once the bot is in
 * the meeting room.
 *
 * ## Meeting session lifecycle
 *
 * `startMeetingSession` owns the in-page feature handles (participant
 * scraper, speaker scraper, chat reader). The returned `stop()` disposes
 * every handle. We intentionally keep this local-in-module-scope so
 * parallel PRs can extend the factory without touching the listener
 * wiring.
 *
 * On `join` we emit a `lifecycle { state: "joining" }` event up-front so
 * the daemon sees the transition even if `runJoinFlow` throws during
 * its first DOM query, then emit `joined` after the flow resolves and
 * the session factory has been installed. An unhandled rejection from
 * `runJoinFlow` surfaces as `lifecycle { state: "error" }` with the
 * error's message in `detail` — the session factory is NOT installed
 * in that case because the scrapers require an admitted meeting.
