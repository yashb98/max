/**
 * Content-script port of the Google Meet join flow.
 *
 * Ports `skills/meet-join/bot/src/browser/join-flow.ts` (which drives Meet
 * via Playwright from outside the browser) to run inside a Manifest V3
 * content script attached to `https://meet.google.com/*`. The selector
 * catalog, timeouts, and branch structure are intentionally kept in sync
 * with the bot-side implementation so the two are trivially cross-referenced
 * when Meet's DOM drifts.
 *
 * Call graph:
 *
 *   1. Dismiss the media-permission modal if Meet rendered one. The modal
 *      blocks the underlying prejoin UI for anonymous joiners; a missing
 *      modal is the signed-in happy path and is not an error.
 *   2. Wait for either the prejoin name input OR a join button — signed-in
 *      flows skip the name input entirely, so treating it as mandatory would
 *      hang the extension for 30s on a page that's otherwise interactable.
 *   3. Populate the display name if the input is present.
 *   4. Click Join now (preferred — signed-in / same-domain flow) or fall back
 *      to Ask to join (locked meeting, host admits).
 *   5. Wait for the in-meeting UI. `INGAME_READY_INDICATOR` (the chat /
 *      participants panel toggles in the bottom toolbar) is the canonical
 *      marker — those buttons only mount once the bot is actually in the
 *      meeting. The red "Leave call" button is NOT suitable because Meet
 *      renders it in both the waiting-room and in-meeting UIs, and the mic
 *      toggle is not suitable because Meet also renders it on the prejoin
 *      lobby as part of the device-preview toolbar.
 *   6. Post `consentMessage` in chat via {@link postConsentMessage}. Best
 *      effort — if the chat composer can't be located we surface a
 *      diagnostic error but do NOT fail the join, since the bot is already
 *      in the meeting at this point and tearing it down would be strictly
 *      worse than a missing consent notice.
 *
 * Error strategy: every step throws a descriptive `Error` on timeout. Before
 * re-throwing, we emit an `ExtensionDiagnosticMessage` via `opts.onEvent` so
 * the bot-side stderr captures the failure reason. We intentionally do NOT
 * capture screenshots — `page.screenshot` has no content-script analogue,
 * and diagnostics already surface through the native port's stderr.

  //
  // ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  // ASSUMPTIONS — this math holds for the production Xvfb + Chromium
  // configuration set up by `bot/src/browser/chrome-launcher.ts`:
  //
  //   - `--window-position=0,0` (window pinned to screen origin so
  //     `screenX === 0` and `screenY === 0` in practice).
  //   - No bottom chrome. We treat `outerHeight - innerHeight` as the TOP
  //     chrome offset, which is only correct when there is no downloads
  //     bar, no bottom-docked devtools, and no permission info-bar below
  //     the viewport. If any of those appear, `outerHeight - innerHeight`
  //     lumps ALL chrome together and we over-count the top offset.
  //   - No side chrome. We ignore `outerWidth - innerWidth` entirely.
  //     Our Xvfb container never renders side panels; a desktop Chromium
  //     with a side panel pinned would need a matching `chromeOffsetX`.
  //   - No fractional DPI scaling. We assume CSS px == X-server px.
  //     Xvfb defaults to DPI 96 and we do not set a device scale factor.
  //
  // Drift signal: if bot-side xdotool clicks start landing above or to
  // the side of the admission button, inspect the live `screen=(x,y)`
  // diagnostic below against a screenshot and audit the assumptions above.
  //
  // MDN footnote: per the spec, `Window.screenX` / `Window.screenY` are
  // the distance from the top-left of the *viewport* (not the browser
  // window) to the top-left of the screen. Read literally, that would
  // make the `(outerHeight - innerHeight)` term a double-count. In
  // practice Chromium under Xvfb with `--window-position=0,0` reports
  // `screenX === screenY === 0` — so the additive chrome offset is what
  // actually shifts the coord from client-space down past the address bar
  // / tab strip. Live evidence: `screen=(1014,536)` for the admission
  // button matched its on-screen pixel position in PR 26602. Do not
  // "correct" this math based on the MDN reading alone — run a headed
  // sibling Chromium (different OS window manager) and re-instrument
  // before changing it.
