/**
 * Participant-panel scraper (content-script port).
 *
 * Ports `skills/meet-join/bot/src/browser/participant-scraper.ts` from the
 * Playwright-driven page-world implementation into the Manifest V3 content
 * script. The polling/diff logic is intentionally identical — only the
 * substrate differs: where the bot-side code used `page.$` and `page.$$eval`
 * to reach into the page world, this module runs *inside* the page world
 * and reads the DOM directly via `document.querySelector*`.
 *
 * Design notes (mirrors the bot-side implementation):
 *
 *   - Meet collapses the participant panel by default. On
 *     `startParticipantScraper` we check whether the list container is
 *     already mounted (`INGAME_PARTICIPANT_LIST`) and only click the panel
 *     toggle if it is not. Without this guard, clicking an already-open
 *     panel would *close* it.
 *   - We read participant rows via `document.querySelectorAll` and extract
 *     `{ id, name, isSelfByDom }` from each row. The stable id comes from
 *     `data-participant-id`; the name is pulled from the
 *     `data-participant-name` / `data-self-name` subselector. We only fall
 *     back to using the name as the id when the row has no stable attribute.
 *   - The first successful poll treats *every* current participant as `joined`
 *     (initial snapshot). Subsequent polls only emit participants whose id
 *     set differs from the previous snapshot. That keeps downstream consumers
 *     (conversation bridge, storage writer) from having to special-case the
 *     "first event" vs. "delta event".
 *   - Errors during a poll (e.g. selector timeout, panel auto-collapsed) are
 *     swallowed so a transient DOM glitch doesn't kill the scraper. The next
 *     poll will retry.
 *
 * Events flow: this module calls the caller-supplied `onEvent` callback with
 * a `ParticipantChangeEvent`. In `content.ts` the callback is wired to
 * `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` so the event flows
 * content → background → native-port → bot.
