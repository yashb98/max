## Overview

This skill walks through analyzing and reducing LLM spend on a Vellum assistant. There are three layers:

1. **Provider connections** — named auth configs (e.g. `anthropic-managed`, `my-personal-key`)
2. **Model profiles** — named presets (model + effort + thinking + contextWindow). Three managed defaults: `balanced`, `quality-optimized`, `cost-optimized`.
3. **Call-site overrides** (`llm.callSites.<id>`) — per-task model/profile pinning. Falls back to `llm.default` when absent.

UI labels for the three managed profiles:

- `balanced` → **Balanced** (Sonnet, good for agent loop)
- `quality-optimized` → **Quality** (Opus, for hard tasks)
- `cost-optimized` → **Speed** (Haiku, for utility/background tasks)

### 🚨 Critical: unoverridden call sites fall back to `llm.default`

If `llm.default` is Opus (or any expensive model), **every call site without an explicit override burns that rate**. Don't rely on just patching a few overrides — use the complete turnkey blob in Step 5 to cover every call site at once.

---

## Step 1 — Understand current spend

```bash
# Weekly totals
assistant usage totals --range week

# Break down by call site (most useful — shows what's expensive)
assistant usage breakdown --group-by call_site --range week

# Break down by model
assistant usage breakdown --group-by model --range week

# Break down by profile
assistant usage breakdown --group-by inference_profile --range week
```

Check `llm.default` — if it's pointing at Opus, that's your biggest risk:

```bash
assistant config get llm.default
```

---

## Step 2 — Read current overrides

```bash
assistant config get llm.callSites
assistant config get llm.profiles
assistant inference providers connections list
```

---

## Step 3 — Recommended profile assignment

| Profile                    | Call Sites                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `balanced` (Sonnet)        | `mainAgent`, `subagentSpawn`, `compactionAgent`, `analyzeConversation`, `patternScan`, `narrativeRefinement`, `memoryRouter`, `memoryConsolidation` |
| `cost-optimized` (Haiku)   | **Everything else** — memory extraction/retrieval, UI copy, classifiers, summarization, background tasks                                            |
| `quality-optimized` (Opus) | **Do not pin.** Reserved for on-demand user escalation via `/model`                                                                                 |

---

## Step 4 — Config gotchas

### ⚠️ JSON object value replaces the entire block

`assistant config set llm.callSites.<key> '{...}'` with a JSON object **replaces the entire `llm.callSites` block**, not just that key.

- ✅ Single leaf value (safe): `assistant config set llm.callSites.mainAgent.profile balanced`
- ✅ Multiple / object values: always set `llm.callSites` as a **single JSON blob** (see Step 5)
- ❌ Never do: `assistant config set llm.callSites.memoryExtraction '{"profile":"cost-optimized"}'` — wipes all other overrides

### ⚠️ Always use profile references — never direct model

❌ Wrong (shows "Custom" with empty provider/model in UI, won't track profile updates):

```bash
assistant config set llm.callSites.memoryExtraction.model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
```

✅ Correct (shows "Speed" in UI):

```bash
assistant config set llm.callSites.memoryExtraction.profile cost-optimized
```

### Profile + tuning fields can coexist

`profile` sets provider/model/connection. You can still add `effort`, `maxTokens`, `temperature`, `thinking`, `contextWindow` alongside it:

```json
{
  "profile": "cost-optimized",
  "maxTokens": 4096,
  "effort": "low",
  "temperature": 0,
  "thinking": { "enabled": false, "streamThinking": false }
}
```

## Step 5 — Apply the complete turnkey blob

This covers **every known call site** — nothing falls back to default. Copy, paste, apply:

> **Note:** The canonical call-site list lives in `assistant/src/config/schemas/call-site-catalog.ts`. If new call sites have been added since this skill was written, add them to the blob below (default to `cost-optimized` unless they involve reasoning or memory consolidation).

```bash
assistant config set llm.callSites '{
  "mainAgent":                {"profile":"balanced"},
  "subagentSpawn":            {"profile":"balanced"},
  "compactionAgent":          {"profile":"balanced"},
  "analyzeConversation":      {"profile":"balanced"},
  "patternScan":              {"profile":"balanced"},
  "narrativeRefinement":      {"profile":"balanced"},
  "memoryRouter":             {"profile":"balanced","contextWindow":{"maxInputTokens":1000000}},

  "heartbeatAgent":           {"profile":"cost-optimized","maxTokens":2048,"effort":"low","temperature":0,"thinking":{"enabled":false,"streamThinking":false},"contextWindow":{"maxInputTokens":16000}},
  "filingAgent":              {"profile":"cost-optimized"},
  "callAgent":                {"profile":"cost-optimized"},
  "proactiveArtifactDecision":{"profile":"cost-optimized"},
  "proactiveArtifactBuild":   {"profile":"cost-optimized"},

  "memoryExtraction":         {"profile":"cost-optimized"},
  "memoryConsolidation":      {"profile":"balanced"},
  "memoryRetrieval":          {"profile":"cost-optimized"},
  "memoryRetrospective":      {"profile":"cost-optimized"},
  "recall":                   {"profile":"cost-optimized","maxTokens":4096,"effort":"low","thinking":{"enabled":false,"streamThinking":false},"temperature":0},
  "memoryV2Migration":        {"profile":"cost-optimized"},
  "memoryV2Sweep":            {"profile":"cost-optimized"},
  "memoryV2Consolidation":    {"profile":"cost-optimized"},

  "conversationSummarization":{"profile":"cost-optimized"},
  "commitMessage":            {"profile":"cost-optimized","maxTokens":120,"temperature":0.2,"effort":"low","thinking":{"enabled":false}},

  "conversationStarters":     {"profile":"cost-optimized","effort":"low","thinking":{"enabled":false}},
  "replySuggestion":          {"profile":"cost-optimized","effort":"low","thinking":{"enabled":false}},
  "conversationTitle":        {"profile":"cost-optimized"},
  "identityIntro":            {"profile":"cost-optimized"},
  "emptyStateGreeting":       {"profile":"cost-optimized"},
  "guardianQuestionCopy":     {"profile":"cost-optimized","effort":"low","thinking":{"enabled":false}},
  "approvalCopy":             {"profile":"cost-optimized"},
  "approvalConversation":     {"profile":"cost-optimized"},
  "trustRuleSuggestion":      {"profile":"cost-optimized"},

  "notificationDecision":     {"profile":"cost-optimized","effort":"low","thinking":{"enabled":false}},
  "preferenceExtraction":     {"profile":"cost-optimized","effort":"low","thinking":{"enabled":false}},

  "interactionClassifier":    {"profile":"cost-optimized","effort":"low","thinking":{"enabled":false}},
  "styleAnalyzer":            {"profile":"cost-optimized"},
  "inviteInstructionGenerator":{"profile":"cost-optimized","effort":"low","thinking":{"enabled":false}},
  "skillCategoryInference":   {"profile":"cost-optimized","effort":"low","thinking":{"enabled":false}},
  "meetConsentMonitor":       {"profile":"cost-optimized"},
  "meetChatOpportunity":      {"profile":"cost-optimized"},
  "inference":                {"profile":"cost-optimized"}
}'
```

Then set the **active (default) profile** to `balanced`:

```bash
assistant config set llm.activeProfile balanced
```

This controls what the app shows as the selected profile in the UI, and matters because of a platform quirk: `llm.activeProfile` takes priority over `llm.callSites.mainAgent` in the resolver (inverted vs all other call sites). Setting both to `balanced` keeps them aligned.

Then verify:

```bash
assistant config get llm.callSites
assistant config get llm.activeProfile
```

---

## Step 6 — Escalation path (on-demand Opus)

Don't pin any call site to `quality-optimized`. Keep it available as a session:

```bash
# User types /model quality-optimized in chat, or:
assistant inference session open quality-optimized --ttl 30m
assistant inference session list
assistant inference session close
```

If the user has a personal API key, wire it as a custom profile:

```bash
# Collect the key securely — never paste it in chat
credential_store prompt --service anthropic --field api_key \
  --label "Anthropic API Key" --placeholder "sk-ant-..."

assistant inference providers connections create my-anthropic-key \
  --provider anthropic \
  --auth api_key \
  --credential credential/anthropic/api_key

assistant config set llm.profiles.opus-personal '{"provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-7","label":"Opus (Personal)","provider_connection":"my-anthropic-key"}'
```

---

## Step 7 — Verify and monitor

```bash
assistant usage totals --range today
assistant usage breakdown --group-by call_site --range today
```

If a specific call site degrades, bump just that one back to `balanced`:

```bash
# e.g. if memory extraction quality drops:
assistant config set llm.callSites.memoryExtraction.profile balanced
```

---

## Reference: provider connections

```bash
assistant inference providers connections list
assistant inference providers connections get <name>
assistant inference providers connections create <name> --provider <p> --auth api_key --credential <vault-key>
assistant inference providers connections update <name> --auth platform
assistant inference providers connections delete <name>
```

Canonical connections seeded on every boot: `anthropic-managed`, `openai-managed`, `gemini-managed` (auth=platform, no key needed).

## Reference: usage breakdown group-by values

`call_site` | `inference_profile` | `model` | `provider` | `conversation` | `actor`

## Reference: usage time ranges

`today` | `week` | `month` | `all` | or explicit `--from`/`--to` epoch-ms
