# Stripe Link Wallet

Spend on the user's behalf using the [Stripe Link CLI](https://github.com/stripe/link-cli). The CLI acts as a wallet: the assistant composes a spend request, the user approves it in the Link app on their device, and the CLI then issues one-time-use credentials to complete the purchase. Use this for paying 402 / Machine Payment Protocol (MPP) endpoints and for ad-hoc agent purchases that should be capped and auditable.

## Required tools

- `bash` for all `link-cli` invocations. Use `host_bash` only if a specific flow genuinely requires host-level access (e.g. reading a local file the user has on their machine).

## Hard constraints

- Always pass `--request-approval` on `spend-request create`. The Link app approval is the consent surface — it is non-negotiable. No spending happens without it.
- Default to test mode (`--test`) unless the user has **explicitly** asked to spend real money. When unsure, ask in chat before dropping `--test`.
- The `context` field must be **at least 100 characters** and must accurately describe what the money is for. The user reads this when approving in Link — write it for them, not for yourself.
- Always use `--format json` on every command. The default interactive Ink output is for humans, not agents. Exception: `demo` and `onboard` require a TTY and have no JSON mode.
- **Amount is in cents.** $10.00 = `--amount 1000`. Maximum is 50,000 cents ($500).
- Never log or repeat raw card credentials (PAN, CVC) in the conversation. Always use `--output-file` when retrieving card credentials.

## Checkout interception — always active

Whenever **any** flow (MCP tool, API call, web request, or otherwise) produces a checkout URL, hosted payment page, or payment session that would otherwise be handed to the user to click through — **intercept it**. Route the payment through Stripe Link instead. Never surface a bare checkout URL to the user as the final step of a purchase flow.

**Decision tree:**

1. **MPP / HTTP 402 endpoint** — Flow A (Shared Payment Token)
2. **MCP service with a `complete_checkout` tool** — Flow B to get a virtual card, tokenize the card against the provider's Stripe account, then call `complete_checkout` with the resulting token
3. **Standard web checkout (no payment API)** — Flow B to get a virtual card, then use a browser automation skill to fill the card into the checkout form

**For MCP-based checkouts (e.g. PostalForm):**

- After retrieving the virtual card from `--output-file`, create a Stripe PaymentMethod via `POST /v1/payment_methods` using the merchant's publishable key (extract from the checkout URL or session if present), then pass the resulting `pm_xxx` token to the MCP's `complete_checkout` tool.
- If the publishable key is not available, fall back to browser automation (option 3) using the checkout URL the MCP returned — do not surface the URL to the user, navigate to it directly via browser automation.

**Never skip this step.** If `link-cli` is not installed or the user is not authenticated, surface that blocker immediately rather than falling back to a raw checkout URL.

---

## Step 0: Check installation and auth

```bash
if command -v link-cli >/dev/null; then
  link-cli auth status --format json
else
  bunx @stripe/link-cli auth status --format json
fi
```

- `link-cli` missing — use `bunx @stripe/link-cli` for Step 0 and every command below.
- Exit 0 but `"authenticated": false` — fall to **Setup: login**.
- Authenticated — proceed to the requested flow.
- `"update"` key present in auth status — mention the update to the user but don't block on it.

---

## Setup

### If `link-cli` is missing

Invoke the CLI on demand with `bunx`:

```bash
bunx @stripe/link-cli <subcommand>
```

In every example below, substitute `bunx @stripe/link-cli` wherever you see `link-cli`.

### If installed but not authenticated

Use your own assistant name for `--client-name` — read it from `IDENTITY.md`. This is the label the user sees in the Link app when they approve the connection.

```bash
link-cli auth login --client-name "<your assistant name>"
```

Opens a browser flow. The Link app will show `<your assistant name> on <hostname>` when the user approves the connection. After it completes, re-run Step 0.

### Introspecting the CLI

If you need the exact flags for a subcommand not covered below:

```bash
link-cli --llms-full                      # all commands, LLM-friendly
link-cli spend-request create --schema    # full schema for one command
link-cli <command> --help
```

---

## Pre-flight: get a payment method ID

Every spend request needs a `--payment-method-id`. Retrieve the user's saved methods first:

```bash
link-cli payment-methods list --format json
```

If the user has multiple, ask which one to use. If they have none, direct them to [app.link.com/wallet](https://app.link.com/wallet) to add one first.

---

## Common flows

### Flow A: Pay a 402 / MPP-protected URL

Use this when the target endpoint returns HTTP 402 and requires a Shared Payment Token (SPT).

**1. Decode the challenge (optional but useful for diagnosing)**

```bash
link-cli mpp decode \
  --challenge 'Payment id="ch_001", realm="merchant.example", method="stripe", ...'
```

Extracts the `network_id` and other challenge fields. Use when the URL is unfamiliar or the challenge looks malformed.

**2. Create the spend request**

```bash
link-cli spend-request create \
  --payment-method-id <id> \
  --merchant-name "<merchant>" \
  --merchant-url "<url>" \
  --context "<min-100-char description of what is being purchased and why>" \
  --amount <cents> \
  --credential-type "shared_payment_token" \
  --line-item "name:<item>,unit_amount:<cents>,quantity:<n>" \
  --total "type:total,display_text:Total,amount:<cents>" \
  --request-approval \
  --test \
  --format json
```

Drop `--test` only if the user has explicitly asked to spend real money — and say so in chat before running.

> **Important — JSON mode does not block.** With `--format json`, `create --request-approval` returns immediately with an `_next.command` value pointing to `spend-request retrieve`. You must then poll for approval.

**3. Poll for approval**

```bash
link-cli spend-request retrieve <id> \
  --interval 3 --max-attempts 60 \
  --format json
```

Polls every 3 seconds, up to 3 minutes. Terminal statuses: `approved`, `denied`, `expired`, `canceled`. If polling exhausts `--max-attempts` while still non-terminal, the command exits non-zero with `code: "POLLING_TIMEOUT"` — report this to the user and offer to cancel or retry.

**4. Pay the URL**

Once status is `approved`:

```bash
link-cli mpp pay <url> \
  --spend-request-id <id> \
  --method POST \
  --data '<json body>' \
  --header "X-Custom: value" \
  --format json
```

- `--header` is repeatable: `--header "Name: Value"`.
- `Content-Type: application/json` is auto-applied when `--data` is provided; user-provided headers take precedence.
- The SPT is **one-time-use**. If payment fails, you must create a new spend request.

Before running, read the URL and amount back to the user in plain language to catch typos.

**5. Report the result** — status code, what the endpoint returned.

---

### Flow B: Virtual card for a standard checkout

Use this when the merchant does not support MPP (no HTTP 402). Credentials are a one-time virtual Visa/Mastercard.

**1. Create the spend request**

```bash
link-cli spend-request create \
  --payment-method-id <id> \
  --merchant-name "<merchant>" \
  --merchant-url "<url>" \
  --context "<min-100-char description>" \
  --amount <cents> \
  --line-item "name:<item>,unit_amount:<cents>,quantity:<n>" \
  --total "type:total,display_text:Total,amount:<cents>" \
  --request-approval \
  --test \
  --format json
```

Omit `--credential-type` (or use the default). With `--format json`, returns immediately — proceed to polling.

**2. Poll for approval** (same as Flow A step 3)

**3. Retrieve card credentials securely**

```bash
link-cli spend-request retrieve <id> \
  --include card \
  --output-file /tmp/link-card.json \
  --force \
  --format json
```

`--output-file` writes the full card (PAN, CVC, billing address) to a local file with `0600` permissions and **redacts card data in stdout**. The JSON output replaces the `card` object with redacted fields and adds a `card_output_file` path. Never omit `--output-file` when requesting card credentials — raw PANs must not appear in the conversation or logs.

**4. Use the card**

The file at `/tmp/link-card.json` contains `number`, `cvc`, `exp_month`, `exp_year`, `billing_address`, and `valid_until`. Hand the path to a browser automation skill or tell the user where to find it. Do not read the file back into the conversation.

### Inspect, update, cancel

Read-only and mutation operations need no extra gating:

```bash
# List saved payment methods
link-cli payment-methods list --format json

# List saved shipping addresses
link-cli shipping-address list --format json

# Retrieve a spend request (no card data by default)
link-cli spend-request retrieve <id> --format json

# Update before approval (e.g. fix merchant URL)
link-cli spend-request update <id> --merchant-url <url> --format json

# Request approval separately (if created without --request-approval)
link-cli spend-request request-approval <id> --format json

# Cancel (valid from created, pending_approval, or approved)
link-cli spend-request cancel <id> --format json
```

---

## Line items and totals reference

`--line-item` and `--total` use repeatable `key:value` format.

**`--line-item` keys:** `name` (required), `quantity`, `unit_amount`, `description`, `sku`, `url`, `image_url`, `product_url`

```
--line-item "name:Running Shoes,unit_amount:12000,quantity:1,description:Trail runners"
```

**`--total` keys:** `type` (required; one of `subtotal`, `tax`, `total`), `display_text` (required), `amount` (required)

```
--total "type:subtotal,display_text:Subtotal,amount:11000"
--total "type:tax,display_text:Tax,amount:1000"
--total "type:total,display_text:Total,amount:12000"
```
