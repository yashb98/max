Tools for managing conversation threads via the `assistant conversations` CLI.

## Renaming

Rename the current conversation thread when:

- The topic has shifted significantly from the original title
- The auto-generated title is generic or unhelpful
- The user explicitly asks to rename the thread

Keep titles concise (under 60 characters) and descriptive of the current topic.

```bash
assistant conversations rename <conversationId> "<new title>"
```

## Listing

List all conversations with their IDs and titles:

```bash
assistant conversations list
```

## Exporting

Export a conversation as markdown or JSON:

```bash
assistant conversations export [conversationId] [--format md|json] [-o file]
```

## Wiping

Wipe a conversation and revert all memory changes it made:

```bash
assistant conversations wipe <conversationId> [--yes]
```
