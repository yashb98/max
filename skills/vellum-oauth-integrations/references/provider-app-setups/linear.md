You are helping your user set up Linear OAuth credentials so the Linear integration can connect to their workspace.

The included `vellum-oauth-integrations` skill handles the generic parts of the flow (credential collection, app registration, connection, and verification). This file defines only the Linear-specific steps.

## Provider Details

- **Provider key:** `linear`
- **Auth URL:** `https://linear.app/oauth/authorize`
- **Token URL:** `https://api.linear.app/oauth/token`
- **Ping URL:** `https://api.linear.app/graphql`
- **Callback transport:** Loopback (port 17324)
- **Requires secret:** Yes (token endpoint needs both client ID and secret)
- **Extra params:** `prompt=consent`

## Linear-Specific Flow

The flow has 7 steps total, takes about 3-5 minutes.

### Step 0: Prerequisite Check

> Before we start - do you have a Linear account with access to a workspace?

If no account, direct them to sign up at `https://linear.app`. If they have an account but aren't sure about permissions, explain that they'll need workspace access to create OAuth applications under Settings > API.

---

### Step 1: Open Linear API Settings

Open: `https://linear.app/settings/api`

> I've opened the Linear API settings page. If it's asking you to sign in, go ahead and do that first - then let me know.

---

### Step 2: Create a New OAuth Application

> Scroll down to the **OAuth Applications** section. Click **Create new OAuth application**.

After the user clicks:

> Set the **Application name** to **Vellum Assistant**.

> For the **Redirect URL**, enter `http://localhost:17324/oauth/callback`.

> Now click **Create**.

**Known issues:**

- If the user sees an error about duplicate application names, suggest a variant like "Vellum Assistant (Personal)"

**Milestone (2 of 7):** "App created - now let's grab the credentials."

---

### Step 3: Copy the Client ID

> You should now see the application details page. Look for the **Client ID** (sometimes labeled **Application ID**). Copy it and paste it here in the chat.

Wait for the user to provide the Client ID.

**Milestone (3 of 7):** "Got the Client ID - now let's grab the secret."

---

### Step 4: Copy the OAuth Secret

> The app secret is shown **only once** right after creation. If you can still see it on the page, copy it now.

If the user missed it:

> If you navigated away and the secret is no longer visible, you'll need to generate a new one. Look for a **Regenerate** or **New secret** option on the application details page.

**Milestone (4 of 7):** "Credentials captured - let's add the scopes next."

---

### Step 5: Configure Scopes

> Now let's make sure the right scopes are requested. The Linear OAuth flow requests scopes at authorization time, so I'll handle that automatically. The scopes we'll request are:
>
> - `read` - read access to your Linear data
> - `write` - write access to update issues, projects, etc.
> - `issues:create` - create new issues
>
> You don't need to configure these in the Linear dashboard - I'll include them in the authorization request.

**Milestone (5 of 7):** "Scopes are set - now let's save everything."

---

### Step 6: Store Credentials, Authorize, and Verify

Follow the `vellum-oauth-integrations` workflow to collect credentials, register the OAuth app, connect, and verify.

> I'll start the Linear authorization flow now. You should see a Linear consent page asking you to allow **Vellum Assistant** to access your workspace.
>
> Review the permissions and click **Authorize**.

**On success:** "Linear is connected! You can now ask me to create issues, check your assignments, search across projects, and manage your Linear workflow."

## Path B: Manual Channel Setup

For non-interactive channels, see [linear-path-b.md](linear-path-b.md).

Key Linear-specific differences for Path B:

- Loopback callback won't work from a remote channel - need public ingress configured
- The redirect URL must be set when creating the OAuth application (or updated afterwards in the app settings)
- The app secret is shown only once at creation time - if the user misses it, they'll need to regenerate it
