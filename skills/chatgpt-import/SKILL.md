Import ChatGPT conversation history into Vellum so users can keep their conversation context and memory when switching from ChatGPT.

## How to guide the user

When a user wants to import their ChatGPT conversations:

1. **Tell the user how to export.** They need to go to ChatGPT Settings > Data controls > Export data. ChatGPT will email them a ZIP file.
2. **Ask the user to upload the ZIP file.** Use whatever file upload tools or skills are available to receive the ZIP.
3. **Run the import.** Once you have the ZIP file path, run:

```bash
bun run scripts/parse-export.ts --file "$ZIP_PATH" | assistant conversations import --json
```

The `parse-export.ts` script parses the ChatGPT ZIP and converts it to the standard import format. The `assistant conversations import` command reads the JSON from stdin and creates the conversations.

The command returns JSON:

```json
{ "ok": true, "imported": 12, "skipped": 0, "messages": 347 }
```

Report the results — how many conversations and messages were imported, and any skipped duplicates.

## Notes

- Only ZIP files are accepted (the full export archive from ChatGPT).
- Conversations are deduplicated — re-importing the same file will skip already-imported conversations.
- Only user and assistant messages are imported (system prompts and tool calls are filtered out).
- Original timestamps from ChatGPT are preserved.
- Imported conversations are automatically indexed for memory search.
