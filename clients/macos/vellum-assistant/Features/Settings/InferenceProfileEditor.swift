/// Form view that edits a single `InferenceProfile` fragment. Mirrors the
/// daemon's `LLMConfigFragment` shape — see `assistant/src/config/schemas/
/// llm.ts` — exposing the leaves the macOS UI cares about: provider, model,
/// maxTokens (maximum output tokens), contextWindow.maxInputTokens, effort,
/// speed, verbosity, temperature, and the two `thinking` sub-fields.
///
/// State ownership:
/// - Edits flow through `@Binding var profile`, so the parent (the
///   profiles sheet introduced in PR 13) owns persistence and decides how
///   the draft maps onto `store.replaceProfile(name:fragment:)`.
/// - The provider/model dropdowns read their option lists from
///   `store.dynamicProviderIds` and `store.dynamicProviderModels(_:)`.
/// - Save and Cancel are wired to caller-provided closures so the parent
///   can decide where the buttons live (sheet header, toolbar, navigation
///   bar) without forcing a presentation style on the editor itself.
///
/// Validation: when `provider` is non-nil but `model` is nil OR not in the
/// catalog, Save is disabled and a warning badge appears next to the model
/// dropdown. Other partial states (e.g. provider nil but everything else
/// set) are intentionally allowed — they form a valid partial fragment.
