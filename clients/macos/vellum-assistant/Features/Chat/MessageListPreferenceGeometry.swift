/// loading, and conversation switches. Treating these non-finite values as
/// real measurements causes downstream logic (bottom-pin detection, avatar
/// follower, pagination) to misbehave, potentially triggering layout
/// feedback loops that freeze the UI.
///
/// This filter centralises the finite-number gate and dead-zone suppression
/// that was previously duplicated across multiple `onPreferenceChange`
/// closures in the view body, and adds the rule that the *last known finite
/// measurement* is preserved when a non-finite value arrives.
///
/// The type is deliberately free of SwiftUI imports so it can be exercised
/// entirely through unit tests.
