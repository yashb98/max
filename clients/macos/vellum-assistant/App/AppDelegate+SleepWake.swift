    /// Installs observers for system sleep/wake transitions to prevent
    /// main-thread hangs caused by stale NSTextView mouse tracking loops.
    ///
    /// When the Mac sleeps while a TextField has an active mouse tracking
    /// loop (`_bellerophonTrackMouseWithMouseDownEvent`), the loop can get
    /// stuck on wake because mouse button state is stale — the button was
    /// released during sleep but the tracking loop never received the
    /// mouse-up event. This causes an indefinite main-thread hang.
    ///
    /// The fix is two-layered:
    /// 1. **Preventive** (`willSleepNotification`): End text editing before
    ///    sleep so any active mouse tracking loop terminates cleanly.
    /// 2. **Recovery** (`didWakeNotification`): Repeat the cleanup as a
    ///    safety net in case the pre-sleep handler didn't fire in time
    ///    (e.g. lid closed mid-click).
