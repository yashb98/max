/// post-hatch provisioning covers the assistant_api_key / platform_assistant_id /
/// webhook_secret trio, but the platform base URL, organization id, and user id
/// are only known to the signed-in client — they never appear in Django's
/// provisioning payload. Normal local bootstrap covers these via
/// `LocalAssistantBootstrapService.bootstrap()`; teleport-to-platform, the
/// local→managed transfer flow, and onboarding skip that bootstrap, so they
/// must inject these fields directly. Without this step the managed
/// assistant's CES has no `vellum:platform_base_url` entry — the in-memory
/// override in `providers-setup.ts`'s rehydrate step stays unset, and
/// `platform status` reports `connected: false` because its lookup is
/// CES-only (no env fallback).
