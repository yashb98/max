/// Thread-safe writer context that processes sample buffers on the serial output queue.

/// All buffer appends happen directly on the serial output queue — no MainActor
/// dispatch. This preserves FIFO ordering across video, audio, and microphone
/// streams, eliminating the buffer-ordering race that caused AVAssetWriter
/// status 3 (`.failed`) failures when multiple stream types dispatched
/// independently to MainActor via unstructured Tasks.
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// Mutable state (`isActive`, `hasReceivedVideoFrame`, `startTime`,
/// `lastVideoTime`, `hasLoggedFailure`) is guarded by an `NSLock`.
/// Immutable references (`writer`, `videoInput`, `audioInput`, `micInput`)
/// are set at init and safe to read from any thread.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// - `processSampleBuffer(_:ofType:)` is called directly from `StreamOutputDelegate`
///   on the output queue. It handles writer session start, buffer appending, and
///   first-frame detection.
/// - `markInputsFinished()` must be called on the output queue after all pending
///   buffers have been processed (via `outputQueue.async`).
/// - `deactivate()` is called from MainActor to prevent further buffer processing
///   during cancel or error teardown.
/// - `hasReceivedVideoFrame` is read from MainActor during the frame timeout check.

/// App-agnostic screen recorder using ScreenCaptureKit + AVAssetWriter.
///
/// Records display or window content to .mov files with H.264 video and
/// optional AAC audio. Stores recordings in the app's Application Support
/// directory under `recordings/`.
///
/// ## Encoder Fallback Chain
///
/// When starting a recording, the encoder tries up to four configurations in
/// order. Each attempt waits 3 seconds for the first video frame before
/// falling through to the next:
///
///   1. **Primary** — H.264 at the source display's native pixel dimensions.
///   2. **Halved** — H.264 at half the source dimensions (2x downscale).
///   3. **HEVC** — HEVC at primary dimensions (only offered when hardware
///      decode is available, used as a proxy for hardware encode support).
///   4. **720p** — H.264 at 1280x720 as a conservative safe fallback.
///
/// If all four fail (writer setup error or no frames within 3s each), the
/// recorder throws `allFallbacksExhausted`.
///
/// ## Dimension Constraints
///
/// All encoder configurations pass through `normalizeDimensions`, which
/// enforces:
///   - **Even dimensions** — H.264/HEVC require macroblock-aligned (even)
///     width and height. Odd values are rounded up.
///   - **Minimum 128px** per axis — the H.264 spec's practical lower bound.
///   - **Maximum 4096px** per axis — real-time encoding limit. Dimensions
///     exceeding this are scaled down proportionally to preserve aspect ratio.
///   - Extreme aspect ratios can push the shorter axis below 128px after
///     downscaling (e.g. 8192x128 → 4096x64), so the minimum is re-applied.
///
/// ## Scale Factor Detection
///
/// `scaleFactor(for:)` determines how many native pixels map to one logical
/// point for a given display:
///   1. Tries `NSScreen.backingScaleFactor` for the matching screen (most
///      reliable — accounts for user-configured scaling).
///   2. Falls back to `CGDisplayPixelsWide / CGDisplayBounds.width` (works
///      when NSScreen is unavailable, e.g. headless or lid-closed setups).
///   3. Defaults to 2x as a last resort.
///
/// ## Display Reconfiguration Monitoring
///
/// During display recordings (not window captures), the recorder registers a
/// `CGDisplayRegisterReconfigurationCallback`. This detects:
///   - **Display removal** (hot-unplug) — cancels the recording, removes the
///     partial file, and notifies via `onStreamError(.sourceUnavailable)`.
///   - **Mode/arrangement changes** — logged for diagnostics but not acted
///     upon, since ScreenCaptureKit handles resolution changes internally.
///
/// The callback is unregistered on stop, cancel, or stream error to avoid
/// dangling references.
///
/// ## Buffer Processing (WriterContext)
///
/// Sample buffers from ScreenCaptureKit are processed directly on the serial
/// output queue via `WriterContext`, with no MainActor dispatch. This preserves
/// FIFO ordering across video/audio/microphone streams and eliminates the
/// buffer-ordering race that previously caused AVAssetWriter failures.
///
/// For the full manual QA validation matrix covering monitor configurations,
/// see `RECORDING_TEST_MATRIX.md` in this directory.
