/// An async sequence that yields deduplicated values from an `@Observable` property.
///
/// Unlike raw `AsyncStream`, this sequence responds to consuming-task cancellation:
/// when the task running `for await` is cancelled, `next()` returns `nil` promptly,
/// releasing all captured references (including the observed object). This prevents
/// leaks when the observed object is replaced (e.g., `rebuildClient()` swapping a
/// `GatewayConnectionManager`) while the old instance's property hasn't changed.
///
/// **Why this matters:** `AsyncStream<Value>.next()` (non-throwing) does NOT check
/// task cancellation — it only returns `nil` when `continuation.finish()` is called.
/// If the consuming task is cancelled while waiting on `next()`, the stream, its
/// internal observation `Task`, and all closure captures remain alive indefinitely
/// (until the observed property happens to change). This wrapper's `next()`
/// installs a `withTaskCancellationHandler` that calls `finish()` on the underlying
/// continuation, unblocking the pending `next()` and triggering full cleanup.

///
/// The sequence yields the current value immediately, then yields again each time
/// the tracked property changes to a different `Equatable` value. The `getValue`
/// closure is called on the caller's actor (the internal `Task` inherits actor
/// context), so it is safe to read `@MainActor @Observable` properties directly.
/// The closure is intentionally non-`@Sendable` because `@Observable` macro
/// synthesizes main-actor-isolated getters that cannot be called from a `@Sendable`
/// context. If the project migrates to Swift 6 language mode, the closure may
/// need explicit `@MainActor` annotation.
///
/// **Cancellation:** When the consuming task is cancelled, `next()` returns `nil`
/// promptly, the `for await` loop exits, and all captured references are released.
/// See `ObservationValues` for details on why this is necessary.
///
/// - Parameter getValue: A closure that reads one or more `@Observable` properties.
///   Called on the caller's actor; must be safe to call repeatedly.
