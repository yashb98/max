      //   1. handle(req) — call A creates controllerA, puts it in
      //      inFlight[req], suspends at proxy.send.
      //   2. cancel(req) — aborts controllerA, removes the entry
      //      from inFlight, marks req in cancelledRequestIds.
      //   3. handle(req) — call B clears the marker at the top,
      //      creates controllerB, puts it in inFlight[req], suspends
      //      at its own proxy.send.
      //   4. Call A's proxy.send resolves first (before B's) and A
      //      begins unwinding. The finally block runs while B's
      //      controllerB is the live `inFlight` entry. A unconditional
      //      delete would evict B's entry, and a subsequent cancel(req)
      //      would find nothing to cancel and silently no-op, leaving
      //      B uncancellable.
      //
      // So: leave `inFlight` alone unless this invocation still owns
      // it. And leave `cancelledRequestIds` alone when a later
      // invocation owns the entry — that later invocation's cancel
      // state belongs to it, not to the unwinding invocation. When
      // there is no `inFlight` entry at all (cancel() already removed
      // this invocation's entry and no retry has arrived), prune the

      // the top-of-handle() cleanup.
