/**
 * Onboarding preference public API.
 *
 * Boolean preferences (`shareAnalytics`, `shareDiagnostics`, `tosAccepted`,
 * `aiDataConsent`, `completed`) are owned by `useOnboardingStore` — a
 * Zustand store with a custom per-key `persist` adapter that maps each
 * field to its existing localStorage key. This file exposes the hook +
 * non-React shim around the store, plus the non-store helpers for the
 * onboarding-only keys that don't fit the boolean store shape
 * (`onboarding.selectedVersion`, `onboarding.lastUserId`).
 *
 * Storage keys are documented in `onboarding-store.ts`. The privacy
 * settings page and the Sentry consent gate read `vellum_share_*`
 * directly — that contract is preserved by the per-key adapter.
