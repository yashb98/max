# Web App — State Management

How client state and server state are managed in `apps/web/`. Zustand
stores for client state, TanStack Query for server state, atomic
selectors, no `useReducer`.

See also [`apps/web/AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) and the umbrella
[`CONVENTIONS.md`](./CONVENTIONS.md).

## Zustand for shared mutable state

Use [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for state shared
across multiple components — messages, turn state, interactions,
conversation list, viewer state. Zustand was chosen over Context +
useReducer because:

- **Selector support.** `useStore(selector)` lets each component
  subscribe to only the slice it needs. Context has no selector
  support — every consumer re-renders on any change, which is
  unacceptable during streaming (messages update every ~50ms).
- **Framework-agnostic store definitions.** Store logic is plain
  TypeScript with no React dependency — portable across environments.
- **Direct named actions.** Store actions are plain functions that
  call `set()` — no dispatchers, no action types, no switch statements.
  See [Zustand store conventions](#zustand-store-conventions).

```ts
// Good — component only re-renders when its slice changes
const messages = useChatStore((s) => s.messages);

// Avoid — every consumer re-renders on any context change
const { messages } = useContext(ChatContext);
```

## Zustand store conventions

Each domain owns its store, colocated within the domain folder:
`domains/messages/message-store.ts`. Store files use
`{domain}-store.ts`. Zustand stores are module-level singletons with
both React hook and non-React APIs (`.getState()`, `.setState()`,
`.subscribe()`), so the file describes what the module *is* (a store),
while the exported hook uses the `use` prefix per React's
[Rules of Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks).

- [Bulletproof React — project structure](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/project-structure.md)

Store creation pattern — separate `State` and `Actions` interfaces,
wrap with `createSelectors` for auto-generated per-field hooks:

```ts
import { create } from "zustand";

import { createSelectors } from "@/utils/create-selectors.js";
import type { Message } from "./types.js";

// State — the data
export interface MessageState {
  messages: Message[];
  activeThreadId: string | null;
}

// Actions — direct named functions (no dispatch/reducer)
export interface MessageActions {
  addMessage: (message: Message) => void;
  setActiveThread: (threadId: string | null) => void;
  clearMessages: () => void;
}

// Combined store type
export type MessageStore = MessageState & MessageActions;

const useMessageStoreBase = create<MessageStore>()((set) => ({
  messages: [],
  activeThreadId: null,
  addMessage: (message) =>
    set((s) => ({ messages: [...s.messages, message] })),
  setActiveThread: (threadId) =>
    set({ activeThreadId: threadId }),
  clearMessages: () =>
    set({ messages: [], activeThreadId: null }),
}));

export const useMessageStore = createSelectors(useMessageStoreBase);
```

Consumers use `.use.field()` in render bodies and `.getState()` in
callbacks — see
[Reading state: `.use.*` vs `.getState()`](#reading-state-use-vs-getstate).

Keep store definitions in their domain folder — adding or removing a
domain means adding or removing a folder.

## Auth state lives in a Zustand store

Auth is cross-domain shared state — used by middleware, route
components, API interceptors, and platform bridges. It lives in a
Zustand store (`stores/auth-store.ts`), not a React Context. This
is critical because:

- **Middleware and loaders** need auth state outside the React tree —
  `useAuthStore.getState()` works anywhere; Context requires a
  component.
- **API interceptors** need to read/write auth state synchronously.
- **Selector support** — components subscribe to only the auth slice
  they need (e.g., `useAuthStore(s => s.isAuthenticated)`).

- [Zustand — Reading/writing state outside components](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/guides/reading-and-writing-state-outside-components)
- [React Router — Middleware](https://reactrouter.com/how-to/middleware)

## Turn state lives in `domains/messaging/turn-store.ts`

Turn lifecycle (sending, thinking, streaming, idle, errored), queue
depth, active tool-call count, and current turn identity are managed
by the turn store. Use `useTurnStore(selector)` in React components
and `useTurnStore.getState()` in non-React code (stream handlers,
reconciliation). Do not prop-drill turn state or dispatch functions.

Action naming follows the
[Flux-inspired practice](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/learn/guides/flux-inspired-practice):
`on*` for SSE-event reactions (`onTextDelta`, `onStreamError`,
`onPollReconciled`), imperative for user/system-initiated actions
(`requestSend`, `cancelGeneration`, `resetTurn`).

## Selector patterns

**New code uses atomic selectors via `createSelectors`** — see the next
section ([Auto-generated selectors via `createSelectors`](#auto-generated-selectors-via-createselectors)).
Atomic selectors per field handle the re-render-granularity problem
without any of the `useShallow` ceremony described below.

### Legacy: `useShallow` patterns (for migration reference)

A small number of pre-`createSelectors` call sites still use these
patterns. They're documented here for historical context and to help
migrate them — new code uses atomic selectors instead.

```ts
// 1. Primitive selector — works without useShallow
const assistantId = useChatStore((s) => s.assistantId);

// 2. Object/array slice — required useShallow to suppress the
//    new-reference-per-render re-render storm.
//    Replace in new code with two atomic selectors side-by-side.
const { messages, assistantId } = useChatStore(
  useShallow((s) => ({ messages: s.messages, assistantId: s.assistantId })),
);

// 3. Derived/transformed state — useShallow doesn't help.
//    Replace in new code with an atomic selector + useMemo in the consumer.
const unread = useChatStore((s) => s.messages.filter((m) => !m.read));
```

- [Zustand — Auto Generating Selectors](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/guides/auto-generating-selectors) (the recommended pattern)

## Auto-generated selectors via `createSelectors`

Wrap every store with `createSelectors()` from `src/utils/create-selectors.ts`
to auto-generate per-field selector hooks. This is the
[official Zustand pattern](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/learn/guides/auto-generating-selectors)
for reducing boilerplate while keeping per-field re-render optimization.

```ts
import { create } from "zustand";
import { createSelectors } from "@/utils/create-selectors.js";

interface BearState {
  bears: number;
  increase: (by: number) => void;
}

const useBearStoreBase = create<BearState>()((set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  increase: (by) => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + by })),
}));

export const useBearStore = createSelectors(useBearStoreBase);
```

Consumers use the `.use` property — fully typed, with autocomplete:

```ts
// Auto-generated selector — one field, minimal re-renders
const bears = useBearStore.use.bears();
const increase = useBearStore.use.increase();

// .getState() still works for non-React contexts (middleware, interceptors)
const { bears } = useBearStore.getState();
```

Prefer `.use.field()` over manual `(s) => s.field` selectors. For
derived/computed values (e.g. `user?.id`), use `.use.user()` and
access the property from the result. See
[Reading state: `.use.*` vs `.getState()`](#reading-state-use-vs-getstate)
for when to use each API.

Reference: [Zustand — Auto Generating Selectors](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/learn/guides/auto-generating-selectors)

## Reading state: `.use.*` vs `.getState()`

Zustand exposes two ways to read store state. Using the wrong one
causes either missed re-renders or unnecessary subscriptions.

| Context | API | Why |
|---------|-----|-----|
| **React render body** (component/hook top level) | `useStore.use.field()` | Creates a subscription — component re-renders when `field` changes. Required for reactive UI. |
| **Event handlers, callbacks, effects, `useCallback` bodies** | `useStore.getState().field` | Reads the latest value at call time without creating a subscription. No stale-closure risk. |
| **Outside React** (middleware, interceptors, stream handlers, `main.tsx`) | `useStore.getState().field` | No React context available — `.use.*` would throw. |
| **Calling actions** (anywhere) | `useStore.getState().actionName()` | Actions are stable references — calling via `.getState()` is always correct and avoids adding the action to dependency arrays. |

```ts
// Render body — reactive subscription
const count = useMessageStore.use.count();

// Event handler — imperative read + action
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  useMessageStore.getState().increment();
}, []);

// Middleware — outside React
const { isLoggedIn } = useAuthStore.getState();
```

Zustand's `set()` is synchronous — `.getState()` after an action
returns already-mutated values. Read state *before* calling an action
when the caller needs pre-mutation values.

## Data fetching: React Query vs direct SDK calls

Use **React Query** for data consumed primarily by React components —
it provides stale-while-revalidate, automatic background refetching,
cache sharing between components, and error/loading states. This covers
most API data: chat messages, assistant state, billing, settings, etc.

Use **direct SDK calls** inside Zustand stores for infrastructure-level
shared state that must be readable outside the React tree (middleware,
API interceptors, loaders) via `.getState()`. This applies when:

1. **Non-React consumers exist** — middleware or interceptors need the
   data synchronously before any component renders.
2. **The fetch is simple** — a single call on login or on demand,
   with no benefit from background refetching or cache sharing.
3. **The store is the single source of truth** — no need to sync
   between React Query cache and a separate module-level variable.

Auth and organization state both fit this category. The generated SDK
client (`sdk.gen.ts`) exposes the same typed API functions that React
Query wraps, so switching from `useQuery(optionsFn())` to a direct
`apiFunction()` call uses the same endpoint, types, and interceptors.

```ts
// Infrastructure store — direct SDK call
import { organizationsList } from "@/generated/api/sdk.gen.js";

const useOrgStoreBase = create<OrgStore>()((set) => ({
  organizations: [],
  fetchOrganizations: async () => {
    const result = await organizationsList();
    set({ organizations: result.data?.results ?? [] });
  },
}));

// Domain data — React Query (used only in components)
const { data } = useQuery(assistantsListOptions());
```

### Why React Query (not SWR or others)

- [HeyAPI `@tanstack/react-query` plugin](https://heyapi.dev/openapi-ts/plugins/tanstack-query) auto-generates type-safe query/mutation/infinite-query hooks from the OpenAPI spec. No equivalent plugin exists for SWR (still in proposal stage) or other libraries — this alone is decisive given our HeyAPI codegen pipeline.
- First-class mutation support, optimistic updates, and Redux-DevTools-style query inspection.
- 12M+ weekly downloads (2026), the most feature-complete option in the React server-state space.
- Boundary with Zustand is documented explicitly — see the section above. React Query handles server state; Zustand handles client state; they do not overlap.

## useReducer is not used for client state

**Do not use `useReducer` in `apps/web/`.** All client state — including
single-hook-scoped state with non-trivial transitions — lives in a
Zustand store with direct named actions (see
[Direct named actions, not reducers](#direct-named-actions-not-reducers)
just below). The dispatch/action-type/reducer pattern is not the
shape we want even inside a Zustand store — Zustand's
[Flux-inspired practice guide](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/guides/flux-inspired-practice)
exists for Redux migration paths, not as the recommended idiom.

```ts
// Good — Zustand store with direct named actions
const useSecretStore = createSelectors(
  create<SecretState>((set) => ({
    requestId: null,
    prompt: null,
    showSecret: (requestId: string, prompt: string) =>
      set({ requestId, prompt }),
    dismissSecret: () => set({ requestId: null, prompt: null }),
  })),
);

// Avoid — useReducer in any form. Locks state to one component subtree,
// prevents atomic selectors, no devtools, doesn't survive remount,
// duplicates the React state primitive we already use Zustand for.
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(secretReducer, initialState);

// Avoid — dispatcher pattern inside a Zustand store. Zustand supports
// this for Redux migrants but it's not idiomatic; named actions are
// independently testable, discoverable in IDE autocomplete, and don't
// pay the action-type/switch tax.
create((set) => ({
  dispatch: (action: SecretAction) =>
    set((state) => secretReducer(state, action)),
}));
```

Why no `useReducer` and no in-store reducer pattern:

- **Consistency** — the codebase standardizes on Zustand stores with direct named actions as the single client-state primitive.
- **Cross-component subscribers** — Zustand atomic selectors handle this for free; `useReducer` requires Context wrapping + cross-tree re-renders.
- **Devtools** — Zustand integrates with Redux DevTools; `useReducer` doesn't.
- **Persistence across remounts** — module-level Zustand stores survive route remounts; `useReducer` state doesn't.
- **No prop drilling** — `useReducer` state must be passed down or wrapped in Context. Zustand selectors are accessible everywhere.
- **No dispatcher boilerplate** — direct named actions skip the action-type union, the switch statement, and the runtime cost of an indirection layer. Each action is a plain function that's testable in isolation.

For state with complex transition rules (state machines), express the
rules as guards inside the named action itself — e.g. `acceptSend`
no-ops if `phase !== "thinking"`. The action stays a plain function;
the rules stay testable in isolation; we don't need a dispatcher
ceremony to enforce them.

**Known exceptions** (slated for migration):

- `apps/web/src/domains/terminal/use-terminal-state.ts` and
  `apps/web/src/domains/terminal/use-terminal-session.ts` still use
  `useReducer` + dispatch. These will be migrated to Zustand stores
  in a future change. Do not pattern-match new code on these files.

## Direct named actions, not reducers

Zustand's recommended pattern is **direct named actions** — plain
functions on the store that call `set()`. Do not use dispatchers,
action-type strings, or switch-case reducers. The `redux` middleware
exists for Redux migration paths but is not the idiomatic Zustand
approach.

```ts
// Good — Zustand-idiomatic direct actions
export const useTurnStore = create<TurnStore>()((set, get) => ({
  phase: "idle" as TurnPhase,
  activeTurnId: null as string | null,
  activeToolCallCount: 0,

  startTurn: (turnId: string) =>
    set({ phase: "thinking", activeTurnId: turnId }),

  startStreaming: () =>
    set({ phase: "streaming" }),

  completeTurn: () =>
    set({ phase: "idle", activeTurnId: null, activeToolCallCount: 0 }),

  incrementToolCalls: () =>
    set((s) => ({ activeToolCallCount: s.activeToolCallCount + 1 })),
}));

// Avoid — reducer/dispatch pattern (Redux holdover)
dispatch: (action) => set((state) => turnReducer(state, action))
```

Each action is independently callable, testable, and discoverable via
the store's TypeScript interface. Consumers call
`useTurnStore.getState().startTurn(id)` or select individual actions
via hooks — no action-type constants or switch statements needed.
