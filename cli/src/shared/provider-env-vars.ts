/**
 * Provider API key environment variable names, keyed by provider ID.
 *
 * Two sources are merged into a single combined map. Both are locally-
 * maintained mirrors of canonical catalogs in `assistant/src/providers/`
 * — the CLI does not import from `assistant/src/`, so drift is caught by
 * dedicated parity tests:
 *
 *   1. LLM-provider env vars — mirrors `PROVIDER_CATALOG` entries with an
 *      `envVar`. Drift guard: `cli/src/__tests__/llm-provider-env-var-parity.test.ts`.
 *   2. Search-provider env vars — mirrors `SEARCH_PROVIDER_CATALOG`
 *      entries with an `envVar`. Drift guard:
 *      `cli/src/__tests__/search-provider-env-var-parity.test.ts`.
 *
 * The combined map is what cloud-infra code (docker.ts, aws.ts, gcp.ts)
 * iterates to forward provider API keys from the caller's environment into
 * containers / VMs. Keeping both kinds of provider env vars in one map means
 * the infra call sites don't need to know which kind is which — they just
 * forward every value whose env var is set.
