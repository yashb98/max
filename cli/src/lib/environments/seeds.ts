 * 100 assistants can coexist without the scan (`findAvailablePort`) running
 * one service's range into the next. Band chosen to sit below Linux's
 * default ephemeral start (32768) and macOS's (49152), and away from the
 * 3000/5000/8000/9000 dev-tool swamp. Production keeps its legacy,
 * non-contiguous port set (7821/7830/6333/8090/8080/8765): cross-env
 * collision is the only problem this change targets, prod is unaffected
 * because only one env's assistants compete on a given machine, and
 * churning it would leave existing hatches on 7821 while new ones
 * allocated elsewhere.

/**

 * One other TS site duplicates the name list:
 *   - `assistant/src/util/platform.ts` (`KNOWN_ENVIRONMENTS`)
 * Drift between these two sites is caught at test time by
 * `cli/src/__tests__/env-drift.test.ts`. Fast follow: hoist the shared
 * list into a `packages/environments` package so both sites import
 * from one place.
 *
 * Custom environments via a user config file are a future phase — see the
 * "Coexisting environments" design doc. Until then, a call site that needs a
 * new environment must add it here and rebuild.
