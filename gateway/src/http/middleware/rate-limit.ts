/**
 * Check whether a request should be rate-limited based on prior auth failures.
 *
 * Returns a 429 Response if the client IP is blocked, or null to continue.
 *
 * Loopback peers (127.0.0.0/8, ::1, and IPv4-mapped IPv6 equivalents) are
 * exempt: a misbehaving local client that can't attach a bearer token must
 * not be able to rate-limit the whole gateway for everything else coming
 * from the same machine (the CLI's `vellum ps`, skill HTTP calls via
 * `$INTERNAL_GATEWAY_BASE_URL`, etc.). The auth middleware already bypasses
 * loopback for token validation; this keeps the rate limiter consistent
 * with that policy.
 *
 * The limiter still accumulates failure timestamps for loopback IPs via
 * `wrapWithAuthFailureTracking` and other upstream callers of
 * `recordFailure`. Since loopback peers never get the 429, `isBlocked` is
 * never invoked for them — which is the only path that prunes expired
 * timestamps — so we explicitly `clearIp` here on every check to keep
 * the per-IP failure map from growing unboundedly.
