 * best-effort fallback).
 *
 * For multiple distinct paths, the result is the deepest segment-wise

 * above any filename, and we can return it unchanged even when it doesn't
 * currently exist on disk (e.g. `cp a.txt b.txt /repo/newdir/` where
 * `newdir` will be created by the command — the intended narrowest scope
 * is `/repo/newdir/*`, not `/repo/*`).
 *
 * Duplicate paths are collapsed first so that `[p, p]` behaves identically
 * to `[p]` — otherwise the multi-path branch's segment-prefix walk would
 * return the full path (a file), not its dirname.
