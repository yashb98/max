/**
 * Tunnel path allowlist sent to Velay on the WS upgrade request via the
 * {@link VELAY_ALLOWED_PATHS_HEADER} HTTP header. Velay parses the JSON-encoded
 * regex array on the platform side
 * ({@link
 *   https://github.com/vellum-ai/vellum-assistant-platform/blob/main/velay/internal/velay/protocol.go
 *   `RegistrationAllowedPathsHeader`})
 * and enforces it for every inbound HTTP and WebSocket proxy request routed
 * to this tunnel.
 *
 * Each entry is a Go RE2 regex string. Patterns are anchored at the start
 * (`^/...`) and either prefix-bound (trailing `/`) or exactly anchored (`$`)
 * depending on the route shape:
 *
 *   - `^/webhooks/` — every webhook handler under `/webhooks/*` (Twilio voice,
 *     status, connect-action, voice-verify, Telegram, WhatsApp, email, Resend,
 *     Mailgun, OAuth callback). Provider-side signature validation is
 *     performed by the per-route handlers in the gateway runtime, not by
 *     Velay.
 *   - `^/v1/audio/` — Twilio fetches generated audio URLs directly on the
 *     public surface (see comment at `gateway/src/index.ts` audio route).
 *   - `^/v1/live-voice` — exact match for the Twilio media-stream WebSocket
 *     used for live voice calls.
 *   - `^/v1/stt/stream` — exact match for the public STT streaming WebSocket.
 *
 * If you add a new public route to `gateway/src/index.ts` that must be
 * reachable through the Velay tunnel (i.e. anything an external provider
 * calls or any unauthenticated callback endpoint), add a matching pattern
 * here as well. The route-table guard test in `allowed-paths.test.ts` enforces
 * symmetry between the allowlist and the gateway's actual public surface.
