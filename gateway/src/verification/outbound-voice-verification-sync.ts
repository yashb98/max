/**
 * Gateway-side polling loop for outbound voice verification session completion.
 *
 * When the assistant places an outbound call for guardian phone verification,
 * the relay server handles DTMF collection and consumes the verification session.
 * However, the assistant process must never write to the contact/trust graph
 * (it is potentially prompt-injected), so no guardian binding is created there.
 *
 * This poller detects consumed outbound phone guardian sessions and creates the
 * binding on behalf of the gateway — the same binding that the inbound path
 * creates via twilio-voice-verify-callback.ts.
 *
 * Long-term: when channel_verification_sessions migrates fully to the gateway DB,
 * this poller will query the gateway DB directly and the IPC dependency
 * will be removed. The cursor is intentionally in-memory because of that
 * migration on the horizon — a persisted table would just be carry-cost.
 *
 * Replay protection (ATL-514). The poller's lookback window can include
 * sessions that were consumed legitimately at the time but have since been
 * superseded by manual revocation or a sibling binding path (e.g. inbound
 * voice verification). `createPhoneGuardianBinding` enforces a recency check
 * vs `contact_channels`: a consumed session whose `updated_at` is older
 * than the most recent guardian binding event (active OR revoked) for the
 * channel is rejected as stale. This is the security-critical guarantee;
 * the in-memory cursor is just a polling optimization.
