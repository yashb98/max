/**
 * One-time data migrations that run after schema setup on gateway startup.
 *
 * Each migration is guarded by the `one_time_migrations` table: once a
 * migration key is recorded, it never runs again. Migrations execute
 * sequentially in filename order.
 *
 * To add a data migration:
 *   1. Create `m<NNNN>-<name>.ts` in this folder exporting up() and down().
 *   2. Import it below and append an entry to STATIC_MIGRATIONS.
 *
 * Static registration is required because the gateway is compiled into a
 * native binary for macOS distribution via `bun build --compile`. In a
 * compiled Bun binary, `import.meta.dirname` resolves to the virtual
 * filesystem and `readdirSync` throws ENOENT.
