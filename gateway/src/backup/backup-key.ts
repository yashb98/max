/**
 * Backup key management.
 *
 * The backup key is a 32-byte random secret used to authenticate / encrypt
 * workspace backups. It is generated once per install and persisted to disk
 * in the gateway security directory — outside the workspace and outside the
 * assistant sandbox boundary.
 *
 * This module is intentionally pure: callers pass the full `keyPath` rather
 * than resolving a default location. That keeps the helpers trivially
 * testable against temp directories and avoids any coupling to gateway
 * startup, workspace layout, or global path helpers.
 *
 * On-disk invariants:
 * - Parent directory is created with mode `0o700`.
 * - Key file is written atomically (temp + `link`) with mode `0o600`, so
 *   concurrent callers converge on the first winner's bytes.
 * - Key file is exactly 32 bytes; any other size is treated as corruption.

/**
 * Ensure a backup key exists at `keyPath`, returning its bytes.
 *
 * - If the file exists, it is read and validated. A wrong-size file throws,
 *   so a corrupt key is never silently replaced.
 * - Otherwise, the parent directory is created (mode `0o700`), a fresh
 *   32-byte random key is generated, written to a unique tmp file, and
 *   atomically published to `keyPath` via `link()`.
 *
 * Concurrency: callers that race here must all converge on the same bytes
 * — otherwise one caller encrypts data with bytes that will never be
 * persisted and can never be decrypted.
 *
 * We use the canonical Unix atomic-create idiom: write full contents to
 * a per-call tmp file, then `link(tmp, keyPath)`. `link` fails with
 * `EEXIST` if `keyPath` already exists, which makes exactly one racing
 * caller the winner; the rest read the winner's bytes. `rename(2)` by
 * contrast overwrites the destination and is not race-safe here — two
 * renames can leave either caller's bytes on disk regardless of who
 * generated them, so a lost caller would return bytes that don't match
 * what's persisted. `link` avoids that entirely.
